Uncanny resemblance? Michael V stars as Ciala Dismaya in ‘Bubble Gang’,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. Bubble Gang's X and Angie de Silva/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Michael V has suited up to portray controversial figure Sarah Discaya after social media users pointed out his striking resemblance to the public works contractor. Discaya made headlines anew in early September when sheadmittedduring a Senate probe that there were instances when her nine construction firms bid for the same government flood control projects. The businesswoman had initially denied the allegations, but after further prodding from Senator Jinggoy Estrada (who waslater taggedin alleged flood control kickbacks in Bulacan), Discaya admitted the scheme. But it wasn’t just Discaya’s revelation that stuck out to the public — it was her resemblance to popular Kapuso comedian Michael V. Memes comparing the two figures’ features had begun to surface, and before long, GMA gag showBubble Gangteased footage and photos of Michael V dressed in a similar garb as that of Discaya’s. In the photos posted byBubble Gang, Michael V had on a wig mimicking Discaya’s hairstyle, two moles in the same spots Discaya has them on her face, glasses, and similar outfit — consisting of an inner top and blazer. In one photo, Michael V was also holding an umbrella, seemingly alluding to Discaya’s statement in an interview with TV and YouTube personality Julius Babao that she bought one of herluxury vehicles, a Rolls-Royce, because she liked the umbrella built into the car door. Michael V’s character was named Ciala Dismaya, a play on Sarah Discaya’s name, appearing to be referring to the Filipino slang term ofshala(meaning fancy) anddismaya(disappointment). The Discayas’ legal counsel, Cornelio Samaniego III,toldGMA Newsthat Sarah is aware of Michael V’s impersonation of her. Samaniego debunked rumors that Discaya was angry at the comedian for the skit — adding that the businesswoman is okay with it. TheBubble Gangepisode will premiere on Sunday, September 14, at 6:10 pm on GMA Network. Sarah Discaya’s construction firms have since beendisqualifiedfrom bidding for government projects. The former Pasig City mayoral candidate and her husband, Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya, have also expressed their desire tobecome state witnessesin the flood control project scandal.

"In Cebu, damaged ripraps mire flood-prone Butuanon river","SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. SLANTED. The state of the riprap near the Pulangbato Bridge Road along the Butuanon River in Barangay Pulangbato, Cebu City on August 27. John Sitchon/Rappler CEBU CITY, Philippines – Multiple portions of flood control structures along Cebu’s Butuanon River were left in ruins after a single flooding incident on August 15. From August 27 to 28, Rappler traced the Butuanon River from Barangay Malubog to Barangay Talamban in Cebu City and from Barangay Canduman to Barangay Paknaan in Mandaue City. There, we found at least four damaged sections of a flood control structure along Sitios Pulangbato Proper, Dita, and Candarong of Barangay Pulangbato, Cebu City, and another damaged section of a riprap along Barangay Casuntingan, Mandaue City. Collated reports from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Cebu 6th District and Cebu City District Engineering Offices (DEOs) confirmed that the damage was linked to the August 15 flooding incident. Engineer Martin Tan of On Point Construction, the contractor for the damaged riprap in Mandaue City, said in aCDN Digital articledated August 16 that the structure collapsed because water rushed from both sides of the riprap wall. Engineer Reynaldo Fernandez of BNR Construction and Development Corporation, one of the contractors of the riprap in Barangay Pulangbato, told Rappler on Wednesday, September 10, that the damaged sections were due to the heavy flooding in mid-August. Historically, the Butuanon River is known to overflow during heavy rain showers, affecting thousands of residents living along the upstream areas in Cebu City and downstream areas in Mandaue City. In September 2022, the Butuanon Riveroverfloweddue to heavy rainfall, resulting in the destruction of 675 houses. At least 1,800 residents were evacuated during the incident. In July 2024,SunStar Cebureportedthat the Butuanon River overflowed again, trapping more than 190 families in Barangay Umapad, and making sections of UN Avenue and S.B. Cabahug Street impassable. But flooding isn’t the only cause for concern when it comes to the Butuanon River. In 2020, the Mandaue city government declared the Butuanon River off-limits to the public after the Department of Health’s Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM), found that the water there testedpositive for the poliovirus. Since 1992, the Butuanon River had been declared adead river— a contaminated waterway incapable of supporting flora and fauna. Jesse Baring, an engineer and convenor of the Movement for Livable Cebu (MLC), told Rappler on Thursday, September 11, that if water along the river rose with greater strength, the walls of the damaged flood control structures could be washed out, placing more communities at risk to flash floods. “The sudden rise in flood water will [reach] the community and larger damage could happen,” Baring said. A quick glance at the website of theNationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards(NOAH) of the University of the Philippines showed that multiple residential areas in Barangay Pulangbato near the Butuanon River are at high risk of flooding. Some of the flood control projects along Butuanon River that were damaged from the August 15 flooding incident were built just a year before. DPWH infrastructure records showed that the riprap in Barangay Casuntingan, Mandaue City, had a contract amount of around P96.5 million and was initiated on February 16, 2024. On Point Construction, the contractor of the riprap, earlier said that the repairs for the damaged portion of the riprap would cost more than half a million pesos. The DPWH Cebu 6th DEO clarified in a statement on August 29, that the damage was caused by floodwaters carrying debris, garbage, and silt that created intense pressure behind the riprap’s wall. Based on the DPWH Cebu City DEO’s damage report, two of the flood control projects in Barangay Pulangbato were completed on December 19, 2024. The first project was a joint venture between Flusskrebs Constructors and BNR Construction and Development Corporation that had a contract amount of around P144.5 million, while the second one was led by BNR Construction with an identical contract amount of around P144.5 million. Rappler visited the office of Flusskrebs Constructors in Mandaue City but was told that they would refer clarifications on the project to BNR Construction. Fernandez, representing BNR Construction, told Rappler that they have met with the DPWH Cebu City DEO to address concerns over the structural design of the damaged portions of the flood control structures. Other projects mentioned in the DPWH Cebu City DEO’s damage report included a P43.9-million flood mitigation project completed by BNR on October 22, 2023, and a P62.2-million flood mitigation project completed by A.T. Tan Construction and ARQ Builders on May 22, 2022. On Tuesday, September 9, Rappler tried calling and visiting the office of A.T. Tan Construction along Vicente Sotto Street in Cebu City to seek their comment but found only a run-down building. Rappler also tried calling ARQ Builders via phone numbers available on their social media page on Thursday, September 11, but our calls were dropped. We have sent a message to ARQ Builders through their ARQ Cebu Facebook page. This article will be updated once we receive their statements. The DPWH Cebu 6th DEO announced that repairs for the flood control structure along Butuanon River in Barangay Casuntingan, Mandaue City, were finished on August 28. “Restoration works began immediately, with reconstruction of the stone masonry and its face wall, the construction of an additional barrier wall to block strong floodwater currents, and the completion of concrete pouring for the face wall in three layers,” the office said in their statement. DPWH Cebu City District Engineer Manolo Madronio Jr. told Rappler on August 29, that since some of the projects in Barangay Pulangbato were finished in 2023 and 2024, they still qualify for warranty repairs. “Etong mga nasira will be at the cost to the contractor dahil pasok pa sa warranty period, and actually, pinapasulat natin mga contractors natin para mainform sila,” Madronio said. (The ones that have been damaged will be at the cost of the contractor since it’s still within the warranty period, and actually, we have written the contractors to inform them.) According to the DPWH Cebu City DEO, repair works have already begun. BNR Construction confirmed to Rappler that they started with their clearing operations in the first week of September. “Nag-clearing [operations] pa ta kay di man pud nato marepair deretso(We are still conducting clearing [operations] since we can’t immediately repair it yet),” Fernandez said. Still, it’s a race against time. While the DPWH coordinates with the contractors for the development of better flood control structure designs, only time will tell when the next heavy rainfall will happen and by then, repair work could become more complicated. “Just pray we don’t get heavy rain that can create a flash flood and that those open or unfinished [structures] could bring flood water to the community,” Baring of MLC said.– Rappler.com How does this make you feel? follow us",Fake

"OVP: Sara paid for own trips abroad, but P7.5M spent on security","MANILA, Philippines — The Office of the Vice President said that Vice President Sara Duterte has been paying for her foreign trips using personal funds, but confirmed that her office has so far disbursed P7.47 million this year for the travel of her security and staff. Kelvin Gerome Tenido, OVP budget division chief, told reporters on Thursday, September 11, that while Duterte shoulders her own and her family’s expenses abroad, public funds cover the costs of the security personnel assigned to her. “All the travel overseas of the Vice President is covered by a travel authority and did not include any public funds,"" Tenido said at a press conference a day before the OVP is set to defend its budget at the House of Representatives. ""The P7.47 million was utilized for the security personnel of the OVP, and including the close-in or the civilian personnel,"" he added. Breaking down the figures, Tenido said OVP had obligated a total of P20.68 million in travel expenses as of July 31. Of this, P13.21 million went to local trips and P7.47 million to foreign travel. Under domestic travel, the OVP has spent P10.05 million for the travel of OVP personnel. Meanwhile, P3.16 million has been spent for Duterte's security personnel. Reporters pressed Tenido on whether taxpayers were still covering parts of Duterte’s overseas trips. He confirmed that while the Vice President and her family shouldered their personal costs, the cost of paying for security is ""under the OVP fund."" In total, for 2025, Duterte's office was allocated P31.5 million for international travel and P31 million for domestic trips, according to data shared by the OVP. For 2026, the OVP is proposing P20 million for travel expenses, under its total proposed P902.9 million budget in the National Expenditure Program. The OVP budget chief noted that the amount is the lowest since 2023, when the allocation reached its peak at P31.5 million. Asked why the figure was reduced, he explained that the Department of Budget and Management sets allocations based on an agency’s absorptive capacity, a rule applied across all agencies. Tenido said the OVP “submits to the wisdom of Congress” on whether to maintain or reduce the allocation during deliberations. The OVP budget chief did not detail the countries Duterte has visited so far this year. He also avoided confirming destinations or future trips, saying they could not provide information on the vice president's schedule.

"Charlie Kirk’s Chilling Warning: ‘If I’m Assassinated, It Will Be Israel’","Charlie Kirk once made a chilling prediction. He said that if he ever spoke out against Israel… they would kill him. Not just smear him. Not just cancel him. Kill him. And he tied that threat directly to his America First values. Because to truly put America first… meant questioning the grip of Israel. Now he’s dead. And not just dead, but taken out in the exact way he warned it would happen. A sniper. Hidden. Waiting. Striking from a distance on a college campus. The perfect stage for a story that could be spun to blame domestic enemies — to fracture America even further. But that’s not all. His assassination serves another purpose. It’s a signal. A warning shot to anyone else who dares to break ranks. BYPASS THE CENSORSSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. You can unsubscribe any time. By subscribing you agree to ourTerms of Use And the question we have to ask tonight is this: who really pulled the trigger? Charlie Kirk wasn’t just another pundit. He wasthevoice of conservative youth in America. And that made him lethal to Israel. Because Israel doesn’t stand on its own. It stands on the shoulders of American conservatives. Without that support, the whole house of cards comes crashing down. If Charlie flipped? If he told millions of young conservatives that Israel was not their fight? It would be over. Within the next generation, Israel would be finished. That’s how much power he held. For Israel, Charlie Kirk wasn’t just a threat… it was existential. Just months before his death, Charlie Kirk began to shift. He starting to speak more critically about certain policies — and certain actors — that everyone knew were tied to Israel. Or, at the very least, heavily influenced by pro-Israel networks. And with that shift came a warning. Kirk said Israel, and the intelligence or political forces aligned with it, had a reach that extended far beyond Washington. Dissent would not be tolerated. And for those who crossed the line… the consequences could be deadly. Most in the media called him alarmist. Conspiratorial. Over the top. But now, after the sniper’s bullet, his words are being re-examined — with a new and chilling urgency. One of the first people to connect the dots publicly was Harrison H. Smith, host onInfowars. In a string of tweets and on-air statements, Smith dropped a bombshell. He claimed that those close to Charlie had confided something terrifying. I posted this nearly a month ago.Yes, it’s true.My source was second-hand, but it came up during a conversation about Rightwing Zionist influencers.https://t.co/mg4uwJKXfj That Charlie believed — deep down — that if he ever crossed Israel, if he ever turned against them… they would kill him. Not just cancel him. Not just bury him in the press. Kill him Charlie’s audience was shifting. You could see it in the comments, in the energy at his events. Every day, more and more of them were turning against Israel. He couldn’t ignore it forever. He was being forced to face that reality. And behind the scenes, he began telling his colleagues what was coming. That he was ready to take a stand. That he was going to align himself with Tucker Carlson… and with Candace Owens. He knew the risks. He knew it could be catastrophic. But he also knew it was inevitable. Because Israel understands one thing very clearly: if they lose the young generation of American conservatives, they lose everything. Their influence, their funding, their unquestioned political support — gone. Charlie saw that. He knew that if he came out and denounced Israel, openly, directly… it could collapse the right-wing’s support for Israel almost overnight. And then… the unthinkable happened. A sniper’s bullet. Fired from a distance. On a college campus. The perfect stage for chaos, fear, and confusion. Within minutes, the narrative was ready-made: blame it on domestic enemies. Blame it on political division. Use it to stoke the fire that’s already tearing this country apart. But for those who had been listening — for those who remembered Charlie’s warnings — the details were impossible to ignore. He said the reprisals could be lethal. He said he would be killed if he crossed the wrong line. Like exposing the Jeffrey Epstein Mossad connections to millions of young mainstream conservatives. Did Charlie Kirk, with his audience of mainstream conservative youth, fly too close to the sun? Did he tell too much truth? Those closest to him are saying yes. Now we’re left asking the question no one in the mainstream will touch: was this just a standard act of domestic political violence… or have we entered a new era… one in which America’s handlers begin taking drastic action to keep the country on its leash? According to multiple experts, this wasn’t random. It wasn’t sloppy. It carries all the fingerprints of a professional operation — the kind of precision you only see from high-level intelligence agencies. So let’s break it down. Let’s look at the evidence. First, consider this. The shooter wasn’t apprehended on the day. Not inrural Utah. Think about that. Utah is small-town America. You don’t just disappear out there. You don’t vanish into the crowd. Not without serious help. So ask yourself — how does a sniper pull off a clean escape in a place where everybody knows everybody, where strangers stick out like a sore thumb? This wasn’t some lone drifter. This was a big operation. Coordinated. Professional. The kind of job that only makes sense if there’s backing — and serious backing — behind it. Second. Watch the footage. Slow it down. On the roof of the Losee Center at Utah Valley University — just moments before Charlie Kirk was shot — there it is. An unknown figure. Not a student. Not a random passerby. Someone in professional attire. Moving with calm. With precision. This is the view to the stage from the Losee Center. A perfect vantage point. And the correlates match what has been released by law enforcement. Roughly 200 yards to the stage, as they say And then there’s the follow-up footage. Right after the shots are fired… look closely. Zoom in. You’ll see an individual sprinting across the roof of the Losee Center. Not strolling. Not confused. Running. Moving with intent. Who was that? Why were they on the roof in the first place? And why—just seconds after Charlie Kirk was taken down—were they making a getaway? This isn’t speculation. It’s on camera. And then the close-up in slow-mo. Unmistakable. This wasn’t a lone wolf with a grudge. This wasn’t chaos. It was deliberate. It was surgical. It was professional. To those who’ve studied it, the conclusion is obvious: this has all the hallmarks of a high-level intelligence operation. And then there’s the final piece. The man on the ground. Black trousers. White shirt. Cap pulled low. Watch closely. He touches the brim of his cap. Then the hand signal. Quick. Precise. Like a baseball coach calling a play. And then seconds later… the fatal shot rings out. That sure as hell doesn’t look random. That’s coordination. This assassination feels eerily like JFK. A shot from a distance. Confusion. A ready-made narrative. And behind it all — the question of who benefits. Because hits like this don’t happen in a vacuum. Someone planned it. Someone coordinated it. And someone gained from it. Whoever it was, the objective was clear: silence Charlie Kirk, and send a message. And until we expose the planners — the hidden hands behind the shooter, the ones shaping the story, the ones who will provide a patsy to be paraded before the normies and vilified — how can anyone talk about safety in America with a straight face? And now, shift your gaze back in time. Remember the attempt on Donald Trump’s life — the Butler, Pennsylvania rally, last summer. And now there’s new video raising serious questions. Footage showing what appear to be very similar signals — hand gestures, subtle cues — being sent by someone standing close to the president. The resemblance to what we just saw in the Charlie Kirk shooting is uncanny. And it forces the question: are we looking at isolated events… or the same playbook, run again and again? Charlie Kirk knew the Trump shooting didn’t add up. He said it outright — the story the media pushed didn’t match the footage, the timing, the signals. He saw the same patterns we’re seeing now. And that made him dangerous. Because once you start connecting those dots, you realize these events aren’t random. They follow a script. A playbook. And Charlie was starting to pull on that thread. Charlie Kirk was flying too close to the sun. He wasn’t just questioning narratives — he was threatening to expose them. And for someone in his position — the spokesman for America’s conservative youth — that was a risk the system couldn’t afford. Always remember the golden rule of political assignations… Don’t ask how, ask who benefits.

Starmer Faces Pressure Over Fresh Mandelson-Epstein Links,"Britain’s prime ministerSir Keir Starmer is facing mounting pressureto sackUS ambassador Lord Mandelson, after the emergence of fresh revelations about his links to the late convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Mandelson’s future as US Ambassador now appears to be hanging by a thread after new emails emerged revealing his close ties with Jeffrey Epstein. MPs from both the Conservative and the Labour parties have called for Mandelson to be sacked but the prime minister has so far stood by the diplomat. BYPASS THE CENSORSSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. You can unsubscribe any time. By subscribing you agree to ourTerms of Use UPDATE: The Foreign Office has just confirmed Peter Mandelson has been sacked by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Earlier this yearMandelson said he ‘regrets ever meeting Epstein’. MSNreports:Sir Keir Starmer said he still had “confidence” in Lord Mandelsonas the Prime Minister faced questions in the Commons over a 2003birthday note in which the Labour grandee described Epstein as his “best pal”. But he soon faced calls to dismiss the peer following reports he had supported Epstein when the banker was being investigated for sexual offences. On Thursday morning, Home Office minister Mike Tapp admitted Lord Mandelson’s messages to Epstein were “disturbing”. The ambassador reportedly told the child sex offender to “fight for early release” shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, and said “I think the world of you” the day before he began his sentence in 2008. Asked for his reaction, Mr Tapp told BBC Breakfast the emails made him “shudder”. He added: “I find it disturbing, those sorts of emails in honesty… we have to just look at what Peter Mandelson saying around his regret and what he knew at the time.” Reports in both The Sun and Bloomberg revealed emails in which Lord Mandelson told Epstein he was “following you closely and here whenever you need” and urged him to “remember the Art of War” when dealing with prosecutors. They prompted calls for the ambassador to be sacked from both Conservative andLabourpoliticians. Tory leaderKemi Badenochdescribed the revelations as “sickening” and said Lord Mandelson’s position was “untenable”. Asking why Sir Keir had continued to defend him in the Commons, Ms Badenoch said: “This is a weak Prime Minister, leading a Government mired in scandal. The public deserves better. “Peter Mandelson needs to be fired now.” She was joined by Labour backbenchers Richard Burgon and Nadia Whittome, who also called for Lord Mandelson to be sacked “immediately”. Both said the peer should never have been appointed to the role, while Ms Whittome added: “We either stand with victims or we don’t.” The Conservatives also sought to increase the pressure on the Prime Minister by tabling a series of parliamentary questions asking for information about what Lord Mandelson had said about his association with Epstein during the vetting process for his diplomatic role. Meanwhile, shadow minister Alicia Kearns called on Foreign Affairs Committee chairwoman and Labour deputy leadership hopeful Dame Emily Thornberry to summon Lord Mandelson to give evidence before her committee. Lord Mandelson himself offered an apology for his links to Epstein, telling The Sun’s Harry Cole Saves The West programme he regretted “very, very deeply indeed carrying on” his association with the financier “for far longer than I should have done”. When asked whether he had continued a business or personal relationship with Epstein after he was charged with criminal offences, Lord Mandelson did not deny he maintained a form of relationship with him – responding: “It was not a business relationship.” He said he “never saw the wrongdoing” or “evidence of criminal activity”, adding he does not believe he is “named in the Epstein files”. Lord Mandelson described the words he used in his birthday message as “very embarrassing to see and read”. US lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents more than 20 survivors of Epstein, said Lord Mandelson should voluntarily sit for questioning by investigators. by Niamh Harris in News0 Charlie Kirk Shot Dead During Utah University Event Massive Solar Farm Approved In UK Countryside Copyright © 2025 Fact Checked Limited.

Maine Mendoza on Arjo Atayde backlash: ‘You are condemning the wrong people’,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. COUPLE. Actor-turned-lawmaker Arjo Atayde poses for a photo with his wife, actress Maine Mendoza, during his inauguration as Quezon City 1st District representative. Maine Mendoza's Instagram MANILA, Philippines – Maine Mendoza has come to the defense of her husband, Quezon City 1st District Representative Juan Carlos “Arjo” Atayde, yet again. Atayde continues to receive public backlash after contractor couple Sarah Discaya and Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya expressed their desire to act as state witnesses in the flood control scandal. The Discaya couple named the actor-turned-politician as one of the17 public officialswho allegedly demanded kickbacks from them. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, September 10, Mendoza maintained her husband’s innocence, attesting that they are honest taxpayers who do not rely on the taxes of the Filipino people to fund their lifestyle. “Both of us (and our families) are financially capable of sustaining the lives that we live, and it’s personally offensive to be accused of spending money that we have rightfully earned outside politics. It’s unfair to reduce everything that we are and everything that we have worked for to that single narrative,” Mendoza wrote. TheEat Bulaga!mainstay said that if Atayde were to ever do anything dishonest, she “certainly wouldn’t defend him and cover for him.” Atayde himself denied the Discayas’ claims in an Instagram story on September 8, saying that he has “never dealt” with the contractor couple. Rappler, however, obtained and published photos of theTopakkactor posing with Curlee and Sarah. An old photo from Atayde’s own Facebook page had also resurfaced — showing him looking at a tarpaulin for a P50-million flood project helmed byWawao Builders. Atayde has since taken the photo down. Wawao Builders had become one of the top Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) contractors starting 2022. Public Works Secretary Manuel Bonoanearlier statedthat they had initial information that some of the firm’s flood control projects in Bulacan were ghost projects. Seemingly alluding to these photos, Mendoza said that they were taken out of context, and asked that the public not forget that “perception is not always reality.” “It is truly distressing to see people suffer in times of crisis because of corrupt politicians who put self-interest above all else, alongside their accomplices.Nakakagalit talaga(It really is infuriating).And we also believe those who are truly guilty should face accountability. Again, the truth will reveal itself in the end. We can only hope and pray that the justice system delivers justice to those who deserve it and to whom it’s due. I know we may be easy targets, but you are condemning the wrong people,” the 30-year-old showbiz personality continued. Mendoza further added that her husband plans to take legal action to clear his name. “Arjo has nothing to hide. He has never been guilty of stealing. I’ll end with this, not all politicians are corrupt — some are just convenient targets. The real villains are celebrating quietly in the shadows,” Mendoza said. This lengthy statement comes after the actress made a brief post on X referring to the Discayas’ claims as “baseless allegations,” asking the public to refrain from spewing hate comments at Atayde “until facts come out.” Atayde wasreelectedas Quezon City 1st District representative in the 2025 midterm elections.

Philippines protests China’s plan to build ‘nature reserve’ at Scarborough,"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has condemned China for its plan to establish a so-called ""national nature reserve"" in Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) — the latest in a string of moves by Beijing to step up its control over the feature. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Thursday, September 11, that it will file a formal diplomatic protest to oppose China's planned construction of the ""Huangyan Island National Nature Reserve,"" warning that the move violates Philippine sovereignty and international law. Beijing refers to Bajo de Masinloc as Huangyan Dao. ""Bajo de Masinloc is a longstanding and integral part of the Philippines over which it has sovereignty and jurisdiction,"" the DFA said. ""The Philippines likewise has the exclusive authority to establish environmental protection areas over its territory and relevant maritime zones,"" it added. The DFA said the move is an ""illegitimate and unlawful action by China"" as it ""clearly infringes upon the rights and interests of the Philippines in accordance with international law."" China's State Council approved the creation of the 3,523-hectare ""Huangyan Island National Nature Reserve"" yesterday, with Beijing's forestry administration later saying it would focus on conserving coral reef ecosystems, according to Chinese state media. Details shared by Chinese state media show that the nature reserve will be set up on China's southernmost island city of Sansha — the prefecture-level city that Beijing established in 2012 to assert its claims in the South China Sea. China's State Council also ordered its agencies to strengthen law enforcement against ""all types of illegal and irregular activities within the nature reserve"" — language that indicates Beijing intends to more strictly police the area and drive out foreign vessels. The statement by the DFA on Thursday urged Beijing to “respect the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Philippines over Bajo de Masinloc, refrain from enforcing and immediately withdraw its State Council issuance, and comply with its obligations” under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the 2016 arbitral award on the South China Sea, and the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. What came before.China’s plan to create a “nature reserve” comes after a year of steadily intensifying activity around the disputed reef. Presence of China Coast Guard (CCG) and Navy vessels has steadily grown in the waters around Bajo de Masinloc since January. Chinese vessels and air assets were also dispatched to and over the area in August, shortly after a rare collision between a People's Liberation Army Navy vessel and CCG vessel during a high-speed chase of a Philippine patrol boat. Bajo de Masinloc lies about 120 nautical miles west of Zambales and has been a flashpoint in Philippine-Chinese relations for more than a decade. In 2016, a tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines, declaring that China’s expansive “nine-dash line” claims in the South China Sea had no legal basis. The ruling also found that China had violated the rights of Filipino fishers by blocking their access to Scarborough Shoal. Beijing has rejected the ruling and continued to expand its presence in the disputed waters. Philstar.com is one of the most vibrant, opinionated, discerning communities of readers on cyberspace.

Order in the Court: What are ghost projects?,"MANILA, Philippines – The term“ghost project”has again become the talk of the town amid theflood control anomaliesthat enraged the public. A “ghost project” is a form of corruption in which government officials, sometimes with the help of private actors, declare a government project as “finished” even though it is not or has yet to be concluded. This violation could fall into many offenses, like plunder (if the government official obtained ill-gotten wealth from the ghost transactions), graft and corruption, and falsification, among others.

"Commissioner’s wife bags flood projects, COA admits conflict of interest","MANILA, Philippines — What began as the Commission on Audit’s (COA) budget briefing in the House turned into a grilling on auditors’ ties to flood control projects, leading its chairperson to concede a conflict of interest involving one of its commissioners. COA Chairperson Gamaliel Cordoba admitted on Thursday, September 11, that Commissioner Mario Lipana faces a conflict of interest with flood control projects. How? Lipana’s wife, Marilou ""Malou"" Laurio, is the president and general manager of a construction firm that actively bags flood control contracts from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). She owned Olympus Mining and Builders Group Philippines Corp., which bagged 11 flood control contracts worth P1.012 billion in Bulacan from 2023 to 2025, according to the DPWH’s Project and Contract Management Application Web. A few of these were joint ventures with Le Bron Construction. Most of the contracts were awarded in 2025. Five of them were essentially one large project, split into packages A to E, all carrying the same vague title: “Construction of Flood Control Structure along Angat River” in Barangay Tanawan, Bustos, Bulacan. These five contracts alone cost P463.23 million, with each package valued at roughly P92.6 million. Meanwhile, four flood control projects were awarded in 2024 and two in 2023. COA, in its report to the appropriations committee, P326.6 million has been paid out of the total project cost of P833.79 million for nine projects of Bulacan First District in just the first seven months of the year. Since 2023, Olympus Mining and Builders Group have focused on flood control projects in Central Luzon, particularly Bulacan. They also took on other infrastructure work, such as building multi-purpose facilities and maintaining roads in Metro Manila. Ran for public office.Laurio even sought a congressional seat in the 2025 midterm elections as the first nominee of Vendors Party-list, despite owning a contracting firm. The party-list, however, failed to secure enough votes. Lipana, born in Bulacan, was appointed by former President Rodrigo Duterte in January 2022, according to COA's website. His term expires in February 2027. Three lawmakers stressed that Lipana is not only a public official but a high-ranking member of the commission that audits government projects funded with public money. The problem, they said, is that his wife has a direct financial stake in government contracts. During Rep. Eli San Fernando’s (Kamanggagawa Party-list) interpellation, Cordoba confirmed that COA is aware Lipana is married to a government contractor, but said they only learned of it through media reports. Rep. Antonio Tinio (ACT Teachers Party-list) questioned him further on whether he believes there is a conflict of interest. Cordoba, however, insisted it was only “potential.” “Mayroon po kayong commissioner, ang asawa niya ay may malinaw na kontrata at ongoing projects pa nga. Again, yung tanong ko, mayroon ba o walang conflict of interest ang inyong commissioner sa sitwasyong ito?” he asked. (You have a commissioner whose spouse clearly has contracts, with ongoing projects at that. Again, my question is, does your commissioner have a conflict of interest in this situation or not?) “Personally, there’s a potential conflict of interest,” the COA chair said, first arguing there would be an actual conflict if Lipana interfered with field auditors of his wife’s projects. Asked if he believed the Constitution was being violated, Cordoba said he thinks there “slightly is.” Tinio then read aloud Section 2, Article 9 of the 1987 Constitution, which bars members of constitutional commissions like COA from having any direct or indirect financial interest in government contracts, franchises or privileges. Pressed again by Tinio, Cordoba admitted he believes Lipana has a financial interest in government contracts since Laurio, a contractor, is his wife. Rep. Leila de Lima (ML Party-list) stressed that the conflict of interest is clear and not merely a “potential.” “I was simply appalled by the fact that the commissioner concerned, you were talking about the commissioner earlier, remains to be in office. For me, it’s a clear case not only of a potential conflict of interest. It’s not a potential conflict of interest. It is real, actual conflict of interest,” she said. Tinio also criticized COA for not acting on the conflict of interest involving one of its two commissioners, suggesting the agency may be colluding with Lipana to keep him in office despite the issue. “Natutulog ba kayo sa pansitan? O mas masagwa pa nga, baka kasabwat din kayo dito. … Kaya alang-alang sa credibility ng COA, Mr. Chair, ano bang dapat gawin? Hindi ba dapat mag-resign na ang commissioner?” Tinio said. (Are you sleeping on the job? Or worse, maybe you’re even in on this. … For the sake of COA’s credibility, Mr. Chair, what should be done? Shouldn’t the commissioner just resign?) He pointed out that the controversy not only damages COA’s credibility but also undermines its ongoing corruption probes in flood control projects. Since commissioners are impeachable officers with no other disciplinary mechanism, Lipana’s choices are limited. He can only resign voluntarily or risk impeachment. But where is Lipana, and why is he not at the budget hearing? According to Cordoba, the commissioner has been on official leave since early August and will remain so until the end of September while receiving medical treatment abroad. He said this has been the case almost every month for the past two years. De Lima urged the COA chair to take the initiative and speak with Lipana. Cordoba said he would do so once the commissioner returns from medical leave. Otherwise, De Lima warned, an impeachment case may follow. “Please talk to him once he reports back to office, otherwise one of us or some of us may initiate impeachment proceedings against him,” she said. “It’s not just about pocketing money, but certain violations like the conflict of interest situation that he is in,” she added, noting they are also grounds for betrayal of public trust. Seeking a higher budget to bump up salaries, Cordoba told the committee that COA auditors are unable to attend all bids and awards committee proceedings because there are not enough personnel in each engineering district. COA requested a P16.2 billion budget for 2026, but was only granted P13.89 billion by the executive branch under the National Expenditure Program (NEP). The COA chief also revealed that the commission has issued thousands of notices of suspension against the DPWH over the past decade. A total of 8,294 notices, worth P313.68 billion, have already been served. A notice of suspension is basically a temporary red flag for transactions that seem irregular until they’re properly explained. He added that there are also around 2,000 notices of disallowance, totaling P5.7 billion, which reject certain audited transactions. On top of that, notices of charge — representing uncollected or undercollected funds — amount to P8 billion. This is just for DPWH alone. Multiple investigations are underway into alleged corruption in flood control projects, with Congress and a new independent commission looking into a decade of infrastructure spending. COA and DPWH are in the spotlight, as congressional hearings see lawmakers trade accusations based on testimonies from the Discaya family and Bulacan DPWH engineers.

Duterte exploring option to be released to the Netherlands,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. DUTERTE IN THE HAGUE. Vice President Sara Duterte addresses supporters who gathered for the 80th birthday of former president Rodrigo Duterte. BEN MONCERATE/RAPPLER MANILA, Philippines – With his choice of an undisclosed third party country in dispute, former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has also explored the option of being temporarily freed in the Netherlands, the host country of the International Criminal Court (ICC) where he is currently detained. “Given the Prosecution’s non-opposition to interim release to the Netherlands, Mr Duterte respectfully requests that the Pre-Trial Chamber order the Registry to invite the Netherlands to make its observations on the possibility of accommodating Mr Duterte for the term of his interim release,” said Duterte’s lead defense lawyer Nicholas Kaufman in a filing made on June 16, but publicized only on September 10. Duterte said that if the ICC pre-trial chamber approves an interim release to the Netherlands, he “would not seek asylum in the Netherlands at any future date.” Duterte has been detained at the ICC detention center in The Hague since hissensational arrest in Manilaon March 11. He was flown out of a government-chartered private plane on the same day of his arrest, sanctioned by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. who said this was in keeping with the country’s commitment to the Interpol which issued the red notice following an ICC warrant. Duterte filed for aninterim release requeston June 12, saying that an undisclosed third party country has already agreed to enforce possible conditions that may be set by the court. But the prosecution “strongly opposed” the releaseto that country. So on June 16, anticipating the opposition from the prosecution, Kaufman filed the request to ask the Netherlands to comment whether it would be willing to enforce the conditions for a possible interim release to the country. Kaufman said the advance request is separate from its main request for a release to their chosen country. Kaufman said in advance that should the Netherlands agree, Duterte would still “seek another State to which he could be released once released into Dutch territory, conditional upon authorization by the Pre-Trial Chamber.” “The Defense would cover any costs expended by the Host State in enforcing the terms and conditions ordered by the Pre-Trial Chamber,” said Kaufman. In their opposition filed on June 23, the prosecution said it will not agree to Duterte’s chosen country because it “does not have the same extensive history of cooperation with the Court.” Some conditions that may be set out, which Duterte has offered to follow, would be to “refrain from public engagement, office, or communications with persons outside his family” and also to “abstain from use of the internet or any electronic devices, such as a mobile phone.” Duterte hasreiterated this requestfor an interim release, after the defense obtained a medical report from its own chosen expert that the former strongman is allegedly suffering from“deteriorating cognitive condition”and thus is physically unable to do the risk factors like intimidating witnesses and committing more crimes. Under ICC rules, if those risk factors are present, a suspect cannot be temporarily released. This new detail offers an insight as to why Kaufmanwas mad at Harry Roque,Duterte’s former presidential spokesperson, who suggested suing the Netherlands for being an alleged accessory to the crime they call as kidnapping Duterte. The ICC pre-trial chamber haspostponedwhat was supposed to be the confirmation of charges hearing on September 23, pending its own determination on Duterte’s fitness to attend the hearing. It has not announced the new date. –Rappler.com How does this make you feel? follow us",Real

China’s Scarborough ‘nature reserve’ a pretext for occupation — NSC,"MANILA, Philippines — The National Security Council warned on Thursday, September 11, that China’s plan to establish a nature reserve at Scarborough Shoal is less about environmental protection than laying the groundwork for “eventual occupation” of the reef. National Security Adviser Eduardo Año said China’s planned “Huangyan Island National Nature Reserve” is “patently illegal,” citing violations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the 2016 arbitral ruling in favor of Manila, and the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. “This move by the PRC is less about protecting the environment and more about justifying its control over a maritime feature that is part of the territory of the Philippines and its waters lie within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines,” Año said in a statement. “It is a clear pretext towards eventual occupation.” The NSC pointed out what it called the “irony” of China invoking ecological protection after years of documented destruction at the shoal. Año noted that the 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling cited evidence of Chinese fishermen harvesting endangered species and damaging coral reefs at Scarborough. “To now claim stewardship over an ecosystem that they themselves have damaged is both contradictory and misleading,” he said. The NSC stressed that real conservation would require cooperation, transparency, and compliance with international law, not unilateral measures that could further restrict Filipino fishermen’s access to traditional fishing grounds. The Department of Foreign Affairs said yesterday it will file a diplomatic protest against Beijing’s plan, branding it “illegal and illegitimate.” China’s Foreign Ministry has dismissed Manila’s objections and defended the reserve plan as consistent with its sovereign rights. “Huangyan Dao has always been China’s territory. To establish the Huangyan Dao national nature reserve is within China’s sovereign rights, which is aimed at protecting the ecological environment of the island, and ensuring its ecological diversity, continuity and sustainability,” China foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on Thursday in Beijing, according to an English translation. Lin added that the plan was in line with “China’s domestic laws and international law,” framing it as proof of Beijing’s “resolve to actively protect the ecological environment and a sustainable planet.” Lin urged the Philippines “to stop violating China’s sovereignty, making provocation, and spreading disinformation, and stop creating factors that could complicate the situation at sea.” Scarborough Shoal has long been a flashpoint between Manila and Beijing. Located 120 nautical miles off Zambales province, the reef is a rich fishing ground and well within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone under UNCLOS. China seized de facto control of the shoal in 2012 after a tense naval standoff, despite a US-brokered agreement for mutual withdrawal. Since then, China Coast Guard vessels have maintained near-constant presence at the reef, severely limiting the entry of Filipino fishers who consider the waters their traditional fishing grounds. The arbitral tribunal in The Hague ruled in 2016 that China’s claim to “historic rights” within its nine-dash line had no legal basis, and that Beijing had unlawfully prevented Filipino fishermen from engaging in traditional fishing at Scarborough Shoal. However, the tribunal did not rule on the question of sovereignty and did not delimit any maritime boundary. The tribunal also found Beijing responsible for causing “permanent and irreparable harm” to the marine environment in the South China Sea through large-scale clam harvesting and reef destruction.

What you need to know about the first BARMM parliamentary elections,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. BARMM Parliament. The new Bangsamoro Parliament building, the former building of the ARMM Legislative Assembly. Bangsamoro Parliament On October 13, more than two million voters will head to the precincts to vote in the first parliamentary elections of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). In this election, voters will elect parties and district representatives. The parliamentary government has 80 seats, but with the exclusion of Sulu from BARMM following a 2024Supreme Court ruling, the region will only have 73 seats up grabs this October. This election is a milestone in the peace process which resulted from a 2014 agreement signed by the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Dependent on the successful conduct of this election is the region’s pursuit for genuine autonomy. Here are some things to know: Under the parliamentary setup, voters will not be directly choosing the BARMM chief minister. Each voter will instead choose one regional political party and one district representative. Accredited organizations will choose their sectoral representatives in special assemblies, rather than through at-large elections. The parliament members will then choose who will be region’s chief minister. 40 seats will go to party representatives, 25 seats go to district representatives, and eight seats are reserved for sectoral representatives. The number of parliamentary districts per province/area are as follows, based on theBangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 58: The Bangsamoro Electoral Office will supervise the election. The office is under the control and supervision of the Commission on Elections. There are seven registered regional parties accredited for this elections: The parties have fieldednomineesfor proportional representation. At least 30% of party-nominees should be female. Moro Ako has the highest percentage of female nominees at 62.50% followed by BGC at 35%. MILF’s party is the United Bangsamoro Justice Party. Meanwhile, the Moro National Liberation Front has two factions vying for seats: MNLF founder Nur Misuari’sMahardika Partyand MNLF Chairman Muslimin Sema’sBangsamoro Party. Meanwhile, there are109 aspirantsfor district seats competing for 25 district seats. Independent candidates can run for district seats. Sectoral representatives cover non-Moro indigenous people, settler communities, women, youth, ‘Ulama (Muslim religious scholars and chief religious authorities), and traditional leaders (royal sultanates). There are two seats each for non-Moro IPs and settler communities; one each for women, youth, Ulama, and traditional leaders. Elected parliament members will occupy their seats for three years and are allowed to have a maximum of three terms.

[In This Economy] Infrastructure corruption in the time of Marcos Sr. vs Marcos Jr.,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. Raphael Reyes/Rappler Outraged by the sickening amount of infrastructure corruption that recently surfaced, Filipinos are now blocking off September 21 in their calendars to join massive mobilizations at Luneta Park. (September 21 is the traditional date when the declaration of Martial Law by the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. is remembered. Others say it should beSeptember 23.) This will come on the heels of violent and even deadly protests inIndonesiaandNepal— similarly sparked by massive corruption scandals. In Nepal, there’s even footage of the parliament buildingburningand the finance minister being chased by a mob in thestreetsand in ariver. We certainly don’t condone violence, but it’s understandable that people should resort to it if such massive corruption is on full display. In the Philippines, our closest brush with this was in February 1986, albeit much more peaceful. The Marcos family was just ousted out of Malacañang Palace, fleeing to Hawaii. In their wake, Filipinos stormed the Palace and saw for themselves how lavish the previous inhabitants’ lives had been. Apart from huge hordes of jewelry, people were greeted with more than a thousand pairs of Imelda’s shoes (a small part of the total collection); hundreds of floor-length gowns and dresses and handbags and scarves and handkerchiefs; dozens of parasols, mink coats, and at least one swan feather gown. Huge jars of expensive perfume were also discovered. All of these were detailed in many references including the bookSome Are Smarter Than Othersby Ricardo Manapat. But the Marcoses took with them to Hawaii some of their most prized possessions, including dozens ofgold barsallegedly. And of course, much of their ill-gotten assets were in the form of money in foreign bank accounts, art works, and real estate properties like buildings in New York. Knowing this part of history, you might find odd President Ferdinand Marcos’ “surprise” about the massive extent of corruption that lingers to this day. Recently, he made the followingstatementwhile visiting Phnom Penh: “We haven’t been following (the rules) apparently it turns out for at least 21 years. Because the date we keep seeing is 2003. So, 21 yearsnang ganito(It’s been going on for 21 years). So, it got worse and worse and worse and worse.” He lamented that corruption is “institutionalized” and “normalized.” But Mr. President, corruption wasn’t invented in 2003. Don’t speak as if it’s something new, and as if your father did not scale up corruption to a historical peak. Incidentally, infrastructure projects were a favorite conduit for corruption during the time of his dictator father, the late Ferdinand E. Marcos. UP economists,writingabout the state of the economy during the Marcos dictatorship, wrote in 1984 that: “the bulk of construction and other capital outlays in both the private and public sectors were not very productive and many were outright wasteful.” They added: “Overdesigned bridges, highways, public buildings or large energy projects designed to secure a political constituency, to get a commission, or to corner a contract.” Sounds familiar? Corruption has always been predicated on good intentions. The economists wrote: “In a number of instances, though the outward purpose of [Marcosian] projects might be endowed with some plausible or social justification, a more urgent reason for pursuing them was the opportunity to use government activity as a vehicle for private gain, whether pecuniary or political.” Just as the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) was supposed to avert a looming power crisis, today’s flood control projects are supposed to redirect water away from people and their houses and livelihoods, as the effects of climate change are expected to scale up in the coming decades. But in the same manner that BNPP was mothballed, so today’s flood control projects crumble in any person’s hands with the slightest force. The idea of “overdesigning” a project is an old trick of the trade. What it means is that a project is specified with more expensive materials or thicker structures than actually needed. On paper, overdesigning a project inflates its budget. But once construction begins, contractors can quietly downgrade to cheaper substitutes (still technically “compliant”) and pocket the difference. This “bait-and-switch” strategy makes it one of the easiest ways to cream off public funds in infrastructure projects. In the case of flood control projects, this may come in the form of using shorter sheet piles than specified, thinning the concrete walls of dikes, or substituting cheaper drainage materials — all of which reduce costs for the contractor but weaken the project and increase flood risks for the public. This is a classic case of what’s called a “moral hazard” in economics: when risky or opportunistic behavior (downgrading or pocketing the difference) happens after the contract is entered. After the deal is signed, contractors cut corners, substitute cheaper materials, or reduce quantities, while still billing for the original (inflated) design. What I just described here is not a new strategy; it’s exactly how infrastructure boomed during Martial Law. The extent of inefficiency in capital outlays during that time was so bad that it manifested in themacroeconomic statistics. President Marcos is just feigning ignorance about one of the corrupt practices that led to his and his family’s enormous (ill-gotten) wealth. Put another way, the same corruption technique that brought about the mythical “golden age” of the Philippines during the time of Marcos Sr. continues to flourish in the time of Marcos Jr. Feeling the political pressure, on September 11, President Marcos Jr. released an executive order creating an “independent commission” to investigate the anomalous infrastructure public works. But to have any semblance of credibility, the President cannot form an investigating body that ought to be investigating the president as well — as the one who prepares the budget and finallyapprovesit every year, pork and all. What’s more, knowing the history of Marcosian corruption, we can expect little reform from someone who benefitted from the spoils of the country’s grandest looting in history. On Episode 4, part 1 of the “BBM Podcast,” President Marcos Jr. was interviewed by Vicky Morales, and he appeared to be “teary-eyed” at one point because of the revelations of corruption. But if you know enough of history, you’ll know these are just crocodile tears. –Rappler.com JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author ofFalse Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.In 2024, he received The Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) Award for economics.

Private Jet Departed Charlie Kirk Shooting With Radar Illegally Turned Off Minutes After Assassination,"Just twenty minutes after Charlie Kirk was gunned down at Utah Valley University, a private jet quietly lifted off from Provo Airport, a private airfield less than twelve minutes away from the scene of the crime. The aircraft, bearing the tail numberN888KG, is deliberately hidden from public tracking at the request of its owner—a red flag in itself. But what happened after takeoff is even more unsettling. Roughly thirty minutes into its flight, the jet suddenly dropped off ADS-B tracking, as if it had vanished into thin air. For nearly an hour there was no trace of it in the skies. Then, just as abruptly, it reappeared—heading back toward Provo, as though nothing had happened. BYPASS THE CENSORSSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox.

By subscribing you agree to ourTerms of Use The unexplained blackout, combined with the aircraft’s secretive status, suggests far more than a technical glitch. It looks like someone wanted this plane—and whatever it was carrying—to disappear. The shooting already bore all the hallmarks of a professional and well-financed hit. Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, 31, was addressing a crowd of nearly three thousand people during a campus event at Utah Valley University when a single high-powered round tore through the gathering, striking Kirk in front of horrified supporters around 12.20pm. Police later said the shot came from a rooftop, fired from a bolt-action rifle. Investigators quickly recovered a palm print, a footwear impression, surveillance video, and even a weapon marked with ideological slogans. Still, despite this wealth of evidence, no suspect has been arrested. The gunman remains at large, and the official silence has only fueled suspicion. It is within this context that the Provo jet take on new meaning. The timing is uncanny: a plane takes off minutes after the attack, its transponder mysteriously going dark, only to return without explanation. Online researchers have begun piecing together links between the jet and a local nonprofit foundation, raising questions about who exactly had access to the aircraft and whether it could have served as an escape vehicle. A professional assassin, after all, would need more than a rooftop and a rifle — he would need logistics, resources, and a clean exit plan. The possibility that the shooter had professional backing cannot be dismissed lightly. Everything about the Kirk assassination carries the signature of a carefully orchestrated operation rather than a spontaneous act of violence. The rooftop vantage point, the precision of the shot, the expensive rifle, and the immediate disappearance of the gunman all point toward planning. Add to this the unexplained radar blackout of a private jet within minutes of the attack, and the outlines of a larger plot begin to emerge. by Baxter Dmitry in News0 Internet Sleuths Uncover Proof Charlie Kirk Was Assassinated By Mossad Charlie Kirk’s Daughter Was Scared By the Noise and Tried to Run To Him Copyright © 2025 Fact Checked Limited.

"While Everyone Followed Charlie Kirk’s Shooting, the Senate Quietly Buried Epstein’s Secrets","As America was transfixed by the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk, the U.S. Senatedeliberately chose that very moment to suppress one of the most explosive stories in recent history— a vote that blocked the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s sealed federal case files. While the nation’s attention was focused on the shocking news, the U.S. Senatevoted 51–49to block the release of the files, quietly ensuring that the documents, believed to contain financial records, flight logs, correspondence, and sworn testimony exposing Epstein’s powerful network, would remain hidden from the public eye. The decision to keep these files locked away was not just a procedural maneuver. It was a deliberate act of suppression.

While the nation’s attention was pulled in one direction by the Kirk tragedy, the Senate chose that exact moment to bury a story that could unravel decades of corruption and blackmail. This is a pattern as old as politics itself: when information too dangerous to the establishment risks surfacing, a convenient distraction suddenly takes center stage. The Epstein case has always been treated as untouchable by those in power. His death in custody, under circumstances that even former prison officials admit “don’t add up,” was the first cover-up. The second is happening now, in plain sight, with elected officials ensuring the public never sees who Epstein was really working for. The vote’s narrow margin shows how close the truth came to breaking through. But truth is dangerous to the kind of people whose names may lie buried in those files. Instead of accountability, Americans got silence. And as with every carefully timed distraction before it, the establishment is counting on outrage fatigue to keep the story from spreading.

"Padilla refutes ‘dirty finger’ photo, says it’s a sign of faith","MANILA, Philippines(Updated 11:50 a.m.)— It was a sign of faith, explained Sen. Robin Padilla after photos of him went viral, where he appeared to be raising his middle finger. The senator refuted reports that he was raising his middle finger at the session where Sen. Chiz Escudero was ousted and replaced by now Senate President Tito Sotto. Padilla provided other photos of himself from a different angle, saying that it was his index finger raised, not his middle one. He called a piece from Rappler “fake” after insinuating that he was raising his middle finger during the ousting. “Ito po, ang ganap na ito, hindi po nangyari ito. Meron pong larawan na tunay,” Padilla said during a livestream on Thursday night. (This, what happened here, it did not happen, there is a photo that is real.) He said that if he did make a mistake, a callout was welcome, but insinuating wrongdoing was foul. Padilla explained that raising his index finger was a sign of faith, indicating that God comes first and turning the symbol into something crude was not allowed in Islam. “Magpapakamatay nalang po ako kung gagawin ko ‘yun,” Padilla said. (I would rather just die than do that.) Islamqa.infosaid that there is symbolism in raising the index finger, as it indicates oneness with Allah. Rappler has since apologized to Padilla and retracted the story, explaining there was a lapse within internal communications. ""We would like to assure our Muslim brothers and sisters that there was no intention to put any sector or faith group in a bad light, and that we are strengthening our internal processes to avoid mistakes like this in the future,"" the news organization said. Padilla was one of the Duterte-allied senators who did not vote for Sotto. Netizens initially suspected that the viral photo of him seemingly raising his middle finger was an act of protest against Escudero’s ouster.

US to pour P13.8 billion into Philippine health programs,"MANILA, Philippines — The United States government announced P13.8 billion ($250 million) in new foreign assistance for the Philippines on Friday, September 12, to strengthen the country's health systems and improve its ability to detect and respond to diseases. The funding, to be implemented by the US Embassy’s foreign assistance section, will support what Washington has identified as its priority areas for health programs in the Philippines and the Indo-Pacific region: tuberculosis control, maternal and child health, and global health security, among others. It will specifically support ""key initiatives such as supply chain management, data and information systems, and laboratory strengthening"" in the Philippines, according to a statement by the US embassy. US Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson said the funding ""underscores the United States’ unwavering commitment to the health and well-being of the Filipino people."" This new assistance package brings the total recently announced US foreign aid for the Philippines to more than P17 billion ($313 million). The announcement follows an earlier commitment of P3 billion ($63 million) in aid that the US said would mainly support the resilience of the energy sector, combat illegal fishing, and develop the Luzon Economic Corridor. This initial P3 billion in foreign aid was the first new assistance announced by the US since it overhauled its foreign assistance programs and priorities under the second Trump administration, which started in January. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the funding in July after meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in Washington, D.C. A senior US State Department official, Jonathan Fritz, said on a visit to Manila in early September that the Philippines was the ""first recipient"" of new assistance funding under the realigned US aid policy.

"Gov’t-led AI plans underway but infrastructure, skills need addressing – think tank","SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. MANILA, Philippines – The global think tank Tony Blair Institute on Thursday, July 24,released a reportoutlining how government strategies on leveraging AI technology for the economy should focus on a human-centric “augmented” approach rather than allowing for the outright automation of tasks. The paper recalls how previous industrial revolutions such as mechanization in the 18th century led to physical labor being superseded by machines — a shift that governments then responded to by prioritizing education that would open opportunities for cognitive work. Now, that cognitive work is at the risk of being replaced by generative AI, which has shown the capacity to process information and data, and produce something out of it such as computer code, a written analysis, or a new image or video. The institute proposes what it calls “augmented intelligence,” an approach that seeks to empower the worker to use AI as a tool, and allow themselves to perform “higher-order tasks.” “By embedding machine-generated insights into workflows, this approach enables a broader segment of the workforce – particularly those in practical, hands-on roles — to perform higher-order tasks such as data interpretation, situational judgement and adaptive decision-making to make roles more productive, meaningful and futureproofed,” the institute says. Examples include care assistants using AI to monitor their patient’s wellbeing, electrical technicians using AI-enabled drones and diagnostics to make repairs, or paramedics using AI to provide timely, critical insights. “In short, augmented intelligence is about creating new kinds of jobs that combine human empathy, judgement and adaptability with the power of AI,” it says. Human empathy, judgement, and adaptability, among other humanistic traits, appear to remain as part of a person’s domain and not that of an AI system’s at least for now. Just as humans found a way to specialize in cognitive work as mechanical tools took over physical labor in the past, the challenge now, as the paper shows, is to find the tasks that only a human is able to achieve. The study looks at 3 countries — Singapore, Vietnam, and the Phlippines — and presents an overview of the challenges that each faces in adopting the “augmented intelligence” approach. In the Philippines, the paper provides 4 examples how this approach might look like in several industries: How does the country get there? The report notes several government initiatives that point to a development vision that has AI squarely in its sights. Under the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028, the National AI Strategy Roadmap 2.0, and Philippine Skills Framework, AI and digitalization are looked at as major components in fostering economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. The AI roadmap presents a plan for integrating AI into key industries, while the skills framework seeks to align educational outcomes with the AI-related jobs of the future. The Department of Education also established The Education Center for AI Research in February 2025 while the National Innovation Council, directly under the President, established an AI thinktank in March 2025 that seeks to inform AI policies and improve the country’s global competitiveness. All of these initiatives are meant to steer the populace to an AI-enabled economy wherein generative AI is expected to contribute P2.8 trillion by 2030, the report says. Will the country get there? The study outlines a few major hurdles. First of all, connectivity remains an issue, especially when one compares connectivity in the cities versus the provinces. It says that policies should “address the urban-rural digital divide by expanding access to affordable digital infrastructure, such as connectivity, and training programs.​” The government needs to come in to help smaller businesses, and industries in the province to address a digital gap that slows down AI adoption. Increasing funding for AI research as well as incentivizing the development of homegrown digital solutions are seen as necessary pillars to help the country reach its AI goals. Upskilling, with the proposed “augmented intelligence” approach will also be urgently needed as the International Monetary Fund expects that 4 out of 10 jobs in the Philippines will be affected by AI. Cybersecurity is a part of the picture as well, as data breaches may erode the trust people have in digital systems. “Stakeholders emphasized the need for a shift towards more proactive policies in which governments do not merely mitigate risks, but actively shape AI adoption to create economic and social value. This shift will include fostering public-private partnerships, setting clear regulatory frameworks, and incentivizing local innovation ecosystems and entities to flourish,” the study says.– Rappler.com How does this make you feel? follow us",Real

DMW aims for bigger budget of P10.2 billion in 2026,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. AKSYON FUND. Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac leads the distribution of P3 million in financial aid to 44 distressed overseas Filipino workers in Doha, Qatar, September 10, 2025. Department of Migrant Workers MANILA, Philippines – Malacañang is proposing a P10.2-billion budget for theDepartment of Migrant Workers(DMW) in 2026, higher than its P8.08-billion budget in 2025. The DMW, which began operations in 2022 following its creation through Republic Act No. 11641, is tasked to uphold the welfare of the estimated 2 millionoverseas Filipino workers(OFWs) across the globe. In the proposed DMW budget, P1.2 billion was allocated for the Agarang Kalinga at Saklolo para sa mga OFW na Nangangailangan (AKSYON) Fund, and P1.3 billion for the Emergency Repatriation Program. In his budget message, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. noted that the AKSYON Fund provides “comprehensive assistance to OFWs, covering their legal, medical, financial, and other essential support services such asrepatriation, shipment of remains, evacuation, rescue operations, and other similar interventions.” DMW Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac also said the department is asking for P12.29 million to establish the Migrant Workers Service Bureau, which would have 17 personnel. The bureau’s main purpose would be to administer the AKSYON Fund, Cacdac told the House appropriations and overseas workers affairs committees during budget deliberations on Friday, September 12. “We feel that there should be a specific unit to administer the fund…. The end-result of this is that the fund will better serve our dear OFWs. More than 100,000 OFWs have benefited from the AKSYON Fund. At the very minimum, we give P50,000 outright to distressed overseas workers,” Cacdac said in a mix of English and Filipino. Saudi Arabia remains the top destination for land-based OFWs, followed by the United Arab Emirates. The DMW’s sole attached agency, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), is poised to receive P3.45 billion. A new administrator took over OWWA last May —Patricia Yvonne “PY” Caunan, who previously served as DMW undersecretary. Caunan replaced Arnell Ignacio, who was sacked andfaces a graft complaintover a P1.4-billion land acquisition deal. Meanwhile, P496 million would go to the OFW Hospital in San Fernando City, Pampanga, for expansion of its treatment facilities and bed capacity.

She did not use any public funds,” Ortonio said. Duterte earlier announced that she would travel to Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan on Sept. 20 and 21, respectively, to attend separate Filipino community gatherings as part of the campaign to free detained former president Rodrigo Duterte. The Japan trip will be her 13th foreign travel this year. Her travel to The Hague, Netherlands was her fourth visit amid the continued detention of her father. In August, she visited Kuwait, France and the Netherlands. Last July, Duterte was in the Netherlands and South Korea; Malaysia and Australia in June; Qatar and Netherlands in May; Hong Kong and Netherlands in March and Japan in January. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has slashed the proposed budget of the OVP by P39 million after it approved at least P902.895 million compared to its proposal of P942.038 million, Tenido said. He said that officials of the OVP are ready to defend their budget as the House committee on appropriations will hear the OVP’s proposed budget today. Tenido said despite a lower budget approved by DBM under the 2026 National Expenditure Program, it is still 21.3 percent or P170 million higher compared to the current budget of P733 million. Tenido added that the OVP budget will return to its pre-2023 levels. Tenido added that the OVP’s proposed budget will not include the Ang Kaibigan children’s book of the Vice President.

Trump Vows To Execute ‘Feral Animal’ Who Murdered Iryna Zarutska,"President Trump has vowed to execute the ‘feral animal’ who murdered 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, who was brutally murdered during what should have been a safe commute on the Lynx Blue Line train at the East/West Boulevard station on August 22, 2025. Discernreport.comreports: Zarutska, who had fled war-torn Ukraine just months earlier in search of a better life, was stabbed repeatedly in an unprovoked attack by 34-year-old Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr. She succumbed to her injuries shortly after, leaving behind a community stunned by the senseless violence. Details of the assault paint a grim picture: Witnesses described Brown lunging at Zarutska without warning, wielding a knife in a frenzy that left her fighting for her life on the train floor. Emergency responders rushed her to a nearby hospital, but the damage was too severe. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department officers arrested Brown at the scene, where he reportedly offered no resistance. The attack, captured in part on surveillance footage, has since been described by authorities as random and brutal, with no apparent motive beyond raw aggression. BYPASS THE CENSORSSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. You can unsubscribe any time. By subscribing you agree to ourTerms of Use Zarutska’s story adds a heartbreaking layer to the tragedy. Having escaped the chaos of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she arrived in the U.S. hoping for stability and opportunity. Friends and acquaintances remembered her as vibrant and determined, working odd jobs while pursuing English classes and dreaming of a future free from fear. “She came here for peace,” one family friend told reporters in the days after the incident, echoing the profound betrayal felt by many in Charlotte’s immigrant community. Instead, she met a violent end on a public transit system meant to connect and protect its riders. The suspect’s history only deepens the sense of outrage. Brown, a local man with a lengthy rap sheet, had cycled through the criminal justice system multiple times before this fatal encounter. Court records show prior convictions for assault, drug possession, and weapons offenses, yet he remained free despite pending cases. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles addressed this directly in a press conference, pointing to systemic breakdowns that allowed such a dangerous individual to roam the streets “This tragedy points to the urgent need to address the gaps in our court system,” Lyles stated, her words carrying the weight of a city grappling with rising urban crime. Brown’s own family has echoed this sentiment, with a relative telling media outlets that repeated leniency from judges contributed to the path that led to Zarutska’s death. These admissions from both sides reveal a frustration shared across divides: a justice system that too often fails to deliver consequences swiftly or severely enough to deter the next act of violence. Into this storm of grief and anger stepped President Donald Trump, who wasted no time voicing his demand for the harshest possible punishment. OnTruth Social, Trump posted a fiery message that captured the raw emotion of the moment: “The ANIMAL who so violently killed the beautiful young lady from Ukraine, who came to America searching for peace and safety, should be given a ‘Quick’ (there is no doubt!) Trial, and only awarded THE DEATH PENALTY.” He followed up without hesitation: “There can be no other option!” Trump’s words cut straight to the core of the public’s fury, framing the killer not as a person deserving of endless appeals but as a beast whose actions forfeit any claim to mercy. By invoking Zarutska’s immigrant journey—from Ukrainian battlefields to an American grave—Trump tapped into a narrative of broken promises, where the nation she sought refuge in failed her at its most basic level: protecting the innocent. This call for capital punishment aligns with recent federal actions in the case. Just days ago, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Brown under a rarely invoked statute: committing an act of violence that causes death on a mass transportation vehicle. If convicted, this federal count could indeed open the door to the death penalty, a prospect that legal experts say might expedite the process compared to state proceedings. “This charge elevates the stakes and sends a clear message,” a DOJ spokesperson noted in announcing the indictment, emphasizing the government’s commitment to holding perpetrators accountable in public spaces like trains and buses. Prosecutors have pointed to the surveillance evidence and witness testimonies as ironclad, supporting Trump’s assertion of a trial with “no doubt” about the outcome. The broader conversation now swirling around Zarutska’s killing extends far beyond one tragic night. Advocates for tougher sentencing reforms argue that cases like this expose the perils of revolving-door justice, where offenders with violent histories slip through cracks widened by overcrowded dockets and plea deals. In Charlotte, where light rail ridership has surged post-pandemic, safety concerns have prompted calls for increased patrols and metal detectors at stations. Community leaders, including representatives from Ukrainian diaspora groups, have rallied for not just punishment but prevention—urging lawmakers to revisit bail policies and mandatory minimums for repeat violent offenders. As the investigation unfolds and Brown’s federal trial looms, the echoes of Trump’s demand resonate in courtrooms and living rooms alike. Zarutska’s death serves as a stark reminder of the human cost when justice hesitates. For a young woman who crossed oceans for sanctuary, the least her adopted home can offer is a reckoning that matches the brutality she endured. by Baxter Dmitry in News0 Declassified CIA Docs Reveal Saudi Gov’t Operatives Orchestrated 9/11 Trans Activist Arrested for Raping a Toddler After Breaking Into Ontario Home Copyright © 2025 Fact Checked Limited.

COA: Allowances for public health workers are subject to conditions,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. PHILHEALTH. A Philippine Health Insurance Corporation office on September 26, 2023. Jire Carreon/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Allowances for public health workers (PHWs) are subject to other conditions, the Commission on Audit emphasized as it affirmed with finality its January 31, 2020 decision upholding the notice of disallowance (ND) it issued to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). The ND came after PhilHealth gave its employees cash perks — hazard pay, subsistence allowance, and laundry allowance — totaling P95.462 million in 2014. The state insurer sought to have its ND lifted. Jose Mari Tolentino, senior vice president of PhilHealth’s legal sector, said the Supreme Court classified the state insurer’s personnel as PHWs and are therefore entitled to certain cash perks under the National Health Insurance Act (RA No. 7875). However, PhilHealth’s motion for reconsideration was denied by COA last week, with the Commission saying the state insurer was merely rehashing old arguments that have already been considered and overruled. “It is the consistent position of this Commission that even if they are PHWs, the entitlement to the benefits is not absolute as it is subject to the other conditions under RA No. 7305 or the Magna Carta of PHWs and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR),” the 15-page COA ruling read. For a PHW to qualify for hazard pay, they must be assigned in hospitals or health facilities that handle contagious or communicable diseased, working within radiation-exposed areas, chemical and medical laboratories working on infectious specimen, conflict zones, or correction and drug rehabilitation centers where there may be risks of physical harm. Subsistence allowance, meanwhile, is only given to PHWs who are on-call “at any and all times” while assigned to a government hospital or any government institution. “The [High] Court has previously discussed that the award of WESA (welfare support allowance) or subsistence allowance is not a blanket award to PHWs and that it is granted only to those who meet the requirements of RA No. 7305 and its IRR, and thus, a sweeping grant of the same justifies its disallowance,” the Commission said. Meanwhile, laundry allowance is only given to PHWs who work in health-related establishments. –Rappler.com How does this make you feel? follow us",Real
Duterte 'unfit for trial'? Lawyer asks ICC to pause hearings 'indefinitely',"MANILA, Philippines — Detained former president Rodrigo Duterte cannot stand trial before the International Criminal Court (ICC) due to “cognitive impairment in multiple domains,” his lawyer Nicholas Kauffman said. In a pleading submitted to ICC Pre-Trial Chamber 1 on September 11, Kauffman asked the chamber to “adjourn hearings indefinitely” due to Duterte’s condition, which he said “will not improve.” “Mr. Rodrigo Roa Duterte is not fit to stand trial as a result of cognitive impairment in multiple domains. Mr. Duterte’s condition will not improve, and, for this reason, the Pre-Trial Chamber must adjourn all legal proceedings in his case indefinitely,” Kauffman’s plea read. Kauffman said there is no need for an additional medical examination of Duterte, citing the pre-trial chamber’s discretion under the law. He also argued that the extensive medical information already provided to the court and shared with the prosecution and Office of Public Counsel for Victims is sufficient. “All of the medical information collated leads to the overwhelming conclusion that Mr Duterte suffers from significant cognitive deficiencies that affect his memory, his daily executive functioning, his visuoconstructive abilities, and his orientation to place and time, while, simultaneously, limiting his capacity for complex reasoning,” Kauffman said. “The aforementioned cognitive deficiencies have been diagnosed not just by the two Defence experts but also by a neuropsychologist instructed by the Medical Officer at the ICC Detention Centre at the specific request of the Registrar. For this reason, the medical data presented to the Pre-Trial Chamber is neither partisan nor self-serving,” it added. Kauffman also included findings from the unnamed neuropsychologist, saying the former president “lacks the capacity to remember, assimilate and apply information to be able to give his lawyers effective instructions.” “He will not be able to fluently recall information from the period relevant to the case, such as to be able to testify. To conclude, Mr. D. will not be able to meaningfully engage with the legal process and is unfit to stand trial,” the report read. Despite this claim, Vice President Sara Duterte has spoken with her detained father several times and shared his “message” with overseas Filipino workers in the Netherlands. The vice president revealed that the ICC prohibited her from sharing the details of her visit. RELATED:ICC reminds VP Sara she can't share details of visits to dad Rodrigo Kauffman’s document seeking indefinite adjournment was revealed by the pre-trial chamber, which voted to postpone the confirmation of charges hearing, initially scheduled for September 23. Charges against Duterte.The charges against the former president are crimes against humanity, involving at least 43 killings attributed to the Davao Death Squad and police actions during his presidency. These incidents reportedly occurred between Nov. 1, 2011 and March 16, 2019. The former president’s anti-drug campaign resulted in a government-reported death toll of 6,000. However, human rights groups estimate the figure could be as high as 30,000, with many victims being small-time drug users and pushers.

Macacua says corruption pulling down Bangsamoro region,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. CORRUPTION PROBLEM. BARMM interim Chief Minister Abdulraof Macacua speaks about corruption in the Bangsamoro regional government during the 50th anniversary of Matanog, Maguindanao del Sur, September 11, 2025. Ferdinandh Cabrera/Rappler MAGUINDANAO DEL NORTE, Philippines – Bangsamoro region interim Chief Minister Abdulraof Macacua on Thursday, September 11, publicly acknowledged what he described as rampant corruption in the six-year-old regional government, saying fraudulent procurement, bribery and uncompleted projects have plagued the region he now leads. Macacua’s revelations were widely perceived as a scathing criticism of the regional government that, until last March, was under the watch of Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) chairman and former interim chief minister Ahod “Al-Haj Murad” Ebrahim. Incidentally, Macacua is running for representative of Maguindanao del Norte’s 3rd parliamentary district under the United Bangsamoro Justice Party (UBJP), MILF’s political party led by Murad. Speaking at the 50th founding anniversary of Matanog town, Macacua told local officials and residents that he had uncovered “numerous irregularities”since taking office in March. “We cannot deny it,” he said. “If we look the other way, then we ourselves become the problem.” Macacua spoke of inflated bids and kickbacks, including a case in which rice was priced at P81 a kilo in a government contract. He pointed out the irony: “Just imagine, our President is having a hard time lowering the price of rice to P20.” Macacua said he canceled that transaction and rejected offers of cash. “I was offered a monthly P27 million, which increased to P40 million the following month just to go with the flow of corruption,” he said, stopping short of naming names. “I did not work hard for that money. Why is this being given to me? That’s another form of corruption.” He also cited another instance when a job applicant allegedly tried to pay for an appointment. “Just last week, I was offered P5 million to appoint an individual to a specific position but declined the offer,” he said, adding that he ordered the money returned. Yet, he also stopped short of naming names. He did not elaborate on his allegations of corruption in the regional government. “Corruption is pulling us down. We have to talk about this publicly, or else we are part of the problem,” Macacua said. Maguindanao del Norte Governor Tucao Mastura, who attended the event, was among those Macacua said he had confided in. “How do we handle this? This is a difficult situation,” he quoted himself as telling Mastura. Deputy BARMM Speaker Baintan Ampatuan said the regional parliament would start looking into how the regional government spent its block grants in light of the allegations made by Macacua. Ampatuan said the BARMM parliament has a finance committee that is in charge of the annual budget allocation for the region’s ministries, and members of parliament have an oversight power over the ministries regarding how they utilize the budget. The regional government receives an annual block grant from the national government, equivalent to 5% of the net national internal revenue collection, to fund its operations and development programs. The grant is automatically appropriated in the national budget and released directly to the BARMM regional government. The BARMM regional government has recently been hit by graft allegations. The region’s Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education is under investigation by the Commission on Audit overalleged irregular disbursements worth P2.2 billion. The region’s education minister, Mohagher Iqbal, has denied wrongdoing. The Bangsamoro region’s Ministry of the Interior and Local Government has also faced complaints over a P680-million rice procurement program. Its former minister, Sha Elijah Dumama-Alba, rejected allegations of overpricing and contract splitting, saying the emergency purchase followed procurement rules during a declared state of calamity. The Bangsamoro parliament’s blue ribbon committee has suspended its investigation into the allegations, citing insufficient evidence. Like Murad, Iqbal and Alba are also UBJP’s nominees for seats in the BARMM parliament. Macacua’s recent pronouncements added to speculations aboutfactions in the MILF and UBJP. –Rappler.com How does this make you feel? follow us",Fake

EDSA ‘Trillion Peso March’ set for September 21,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. PROTEST. Activists from Tindig Pilipinas, Nagkaisa Labor Coalition, Kalipunan ng Kilusang Masa, SIKLAB, and Akbayan gather to protest the widespread government corruption, at the EDSA Shrine on September 11, 2025, Jire Carreon/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Catholic and Protestant leaders called on Filipinos to join what is supposed to be a massive protest at the People Power Monument to denounce corruption involving billions of pesos in flood control projects. The rally, called the Trillion Peso March, is set for Sunday, September 21, at the People Power Monument located at EDSA corner White Plains in Quezon City. It begins at 2 pm. The date is symbolic because it marks the 53rd anniversary of thedeclaration of Martial Lawunder dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, the incumbent president’s father. The location of the protest memorializes the1986 People Power Revolutionthat ousted the Marcos family. The name Trillion Peso March, meanwhile, is an allusion to theP1.9 trillion ($33.27 billion)spent on flood control over the past 15 years, a large part of which goes to corruption. It is reminiscent of theMillion People Marchon August 26, 2013 under then-president Benigno Aquino III that condemned the corruption in the Napoles pork barrel scam. It was then dubbed “the Philippines’first social media-organized protest.” The Church Leaders Council for National Transformation, which is composed of Catholic and Protestant representatives, said they are mounting the Trillion Peso March alongside civil society organizations. Prior to this, a number of protests had also been heldat the historic EDSA Shrine. (Watch the video report below on the September 11 protest at EDSA Shrine.) They urged participants on September 21 to “come in white shirts as a symbol of unity and hope.” “This is not just a financial scandal. It is a betrayal of dignity and life itself. Every peso stolen is a life put at risk. Every corrupt deal is a flood that submerges our nation’s future,” said Novaliches Bishop Roberto Gaa, who is part of the CLCNT. Kidapawan Bishop Jose Colin Bagaforo, president of Caritas Philippines, said that “the poor are the first to drown in corruption.” “We cannot remain silent while our people wade through floods that could have been prevented if public funds were used honestly. To steal what belongs to the poor is not only a crime against the nation, but a grave sin against God,” said Bagaforo. Bishop Efraim Tendero, an Evangelical leader, said: “We call on every Filipino — regardless of faith, political color, or social standing — to set aside differences and unite in the spirit of EDSA. This is not just about one scandal. It is about reclaiming our future from the grip of corruption and impunity.” The organizers said the following groups are also joining the protest: More groups are expected to join the September 21 protest.– Rappler.com How does this make you feel? follow us",Fake

ICC prosecution rejects indefinite delay of Duterte trial,"ICC prosecution to field own expert to assess Duterte's fitness to stand trial MANILA, Philippines — The International Criminal Court's prosecution has asked judges to reject former President Rodrigo Duterte’s bid to indefinitely suspend proceedings over his health, saying a short delay may be warranted but the case must move forward with a ruling on his fitness to stand trial before the end of 2025. In a filing made public on Thursday, September 11, ICC Deputy Prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang said the defense's concerns that Duterte's current health conditions make him unable to stand trial, this is ""not sufficient, on their own, to form the Chamber's decision on the matter."" The prosecution is currently engaging its own expert and has asked the court to order additional medical assessments to determine whether the 80-year-old can participate in the proceedings, according to the document filed August 28. The defense earlier submitted a request seeking an indefinite adjournment of the proceedings against him, claiming Duterte was “not fit to stand trial” due to significant cognitive impairments. Duterte's lawyer Nicholas Kaufman said in the publicly redacted version of the filing that the former president would ""not be able to fluently recall information from the period relevant to the case, such as to be able to testify."" Kaufman said Duterte was suffering from an ""impaired memory and concomitant inability to retain new information or to recall events, places, timing, or even members of his close family"" and his own defense team. However, the ICC prosecution countered that these findings lacked clarity on which standards it applied to, and did not prove Duterte could not meaningfully exercise his fair trial rights. “The proceedings against Mr Duterte cannot be ‘adjourned indefinitely’ on the sole basis of the reports"" submitted by the defense, the prosecution said in the publicly redacted version of the filing. The filing stressed that it is ultimately for the chamber — not the defense — to decide on Duterte’s condition. The prosecution also urged the judges to order further medical examinations, ideally by experts who have experience not just in the fields relevant to Duterte's medical conditions, but those with ""forensic experience in the issue of fitness to stand trial"" and ""in providing expert reports and testimony before various courts."" Such experts, the filing said, should also be “familiar with legal proceedings in general and sufficiently familiar with proceedings at this Court, or at other international courts or tribunals,"" the prosecution said. They should also be able to recommend “any specific measures or adjustments that can be applied to facilitate Mr Duterte’s participation in the proceedings,"" it added. The ICC prosecution added that while a short adjournment might be warranted, the proceedings should not be delayed indefinitely, and a ruling on Duterte’s fitness should be reached in time to allow a confirmation of charges hearing within the year. The fitness question has resulted in the ICC pre-trial chamber's decision to postpone the confirmation of charges hearing, which was originally set September 23. This hearing would determine if there is enough evidence to proceed to the actual trial. Lawyers representing the alleged drug war victims haveexpresseddismay over the postponement and believe the claim of poor health is another one of the former president's attempts to delay and defer the proceedings. At least 303 alleged drug war victims have signified their intent to participate in proceedings against Duterte, according to ICC records. Duterte is accused of committing crimes against humanity over his bloody drug war that claimed more than 6,000 lives.

House defers OVP budget hearing after Duterte sends low-level rep,"MANILA, Philippines — The House of Representatives on Friday, September 12, deferred deliberations on the Office of the Vice President’s proposed 2026 budget after it sought to field an assistant secretary in place of Vice President Sara Duterte or her more senior officials. Rep. Jose Alvarez (Palawan, 2nd District), House appropriations committee vice chairperson, said the OVP had written the panel saying OVP Assistant Secretary Lemuel Ortonio would attend today's hearing to defend the budget. But consistent with House practice, Alvarez explained, agencies must send either their head or at least an undersecretary-level official. “Consistent with the tradition of the House, the head of agency or at the very least, an undersecretary should come here to defend the budget of the agency,” Alvarez said during the hearing. “Noting the inconsistency in the letter, I myself advised them in the morning not to come here because it is the same if Usec. Zuleika Lopez is not here,"" the lawmaker said, referring to Duterte's chief-of-staff. Alvarez added that before noon, he was assured Duterte herself would attend the rescheduled hearing next Tuesday. The OVP's proposed spending plan for 2026 is P902.8 million. This is around a 21% increase from its P744-million budget this year — the lowest Duterte's office has ever received. OVP spokesperson Ruth Castelo previously said the office was ""ready for any eventuality"" when it defends its proposed 2026 budget. There was also a brief debate during the hearing on whether to extend parliamentary courtesy to the OVP, a tradition that shields top officials from rigorous questioning during budget hearings. Duterte had benefited from parliamentary courtesy during the budget deliberations in 2022 and 2023. This was no longer the case in 2024, however, when lawmakers sought to grill the vice president over her use of confidential funds. On Friday, Rep. Edgar Erice (Caloocan, 2nd District), House senior deputy minority leader, said he was ready to move to grant the courtesy had Duterte been present. But Rep. Antonio Tinio (ACT Teachers) — also part of the minority — strongly opposed Erice's suggestions, saying it would yet again undermine Congress’ oversight role on the budget. “With due respect to my fellow member of the minority, not all minorities agree to extend the parliamentary courtesy whether to the Office of the President or the Office of the Vice President,” Tinio said. “Especially now, there is no time for parliamentary courtesy. Everyone should be prepared to defend the budget in front of Congress.” Tinio expressed indignation over the OVP’s attempt to send an assistant secretary, noting that even the Office of the President sends its executive secretary. He added that Duterte has repeatedly declared in media interviews that she is ready to defend her budget. “Outside, she says she has nothing to hide and is willing to face the proper venue. But the proper venue is here, in this committee,” Tinio said. While Alvarez relayed Duterte’s assurance that she will appear on Tuesday, Tinio said lawmakers should not rely on her word. “For me, to see is to believe,” he said. Tinio also urged the chamber to abandon the tradition of parliamentary courtesy altogether. “History shows that the so-called presumption of regularity does not work. The norm should be that all officials entrusted with public funds must explain before Congress,” he said.

Authorities admitted on Thursday that they don’t know whether or not he has left the state.“We have no idea,”Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason told NBC News. At a press conference on Thursday evening, Cox confirmed that state officials will“pursue the death penalty”once the suspect is caught. “We’ve been working with our attorneys, getting everything that we need, affidavits ready, so that we can pursue the death penalty in this case. And that will happen here in the state of Utah,”Cox said. The governor had already issued a warning the day before:“I want to make it crystal clear right now, to whoever did this, we will find you. We will try you. And we will hold you accountable to the furthest extent of the law… And I just want to remind people that we still have the death penalty here in the state of Utah.” The FBI has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of the assassin. Director Kash Patel traveled to Utah on Thursday and was spotted at the scene of the shooting, near the canopy tent where Kirk was gunned down during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University. The agency has also released images of a potential suspect captured on security cameras: a man wearing sunglasses, a black hat, and a long-sleeve black shirt featuring an American flag. Kirk, 31, was struck by a single rifle shot as he addressed thousands of students on Wednesday. He was rushed to Timpanogos Regional Hospital but later died of his wounds.

UK Home Office To House Illegal Migrants In Student Accommodation,"Residents of one UK city have been left outraged after it was revealed that the Home Office have been secretly planning to house asylum seekers in student accommodation. In a bid to tackle increasing pressure to move the migrants out of hotels, applications have been submitted to convert university flats to accommodate them instead. The Expressreports: One example, revealed byThe Sun, includes a 247-bedroom block of flats in Leeds which is close to the famous Otley Run pub crawl. Mary Morris House in Headingley, owned by a London property firm, may soon house asylum seekers instead. The application to convert it into a hostel was submitted last month, with the outcome expected in October. The documents do not mention the conversion being for asylum seekers – it was only when Leeds City Council released a statement which clarified the application.

By subscribing you agree to ourTerms of Use The council said: “The Home Office has advised the council that the submission is part of wider central government efforts to reduce the reliance on hotel use for those seeking asylum.” Since the application was made public, locals in Leeds have expressed their anger. “I have concerns for residents’ safety,” 21-year-old student nurse Sara Bejoy told the newspaper. “Also, it is so close to the Otley Run, where there are a lot of drunk girls in outfits. “This could be confusing for immigrants, not knowing the culture, and something bad might happen. “I come back from work at 11pm and I would not feel safe.” Leeds resident Charles McAdam, 62, claims Leeds City Council and the Government “are turning a deaf ear to genuine concerns.” “Putting a lot of young foreign males in a place like this, where there are a lot of young girls away from their parents for the first time and could be vulnerable, is not a good idea,” he said. The revelation of student digs being earmarked to house migrants has now sparked fear that other university accommodations may be targeted next. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: “This is a huge waste of taxpayers’ money and shows the government has totally lost control of our borders. “A new Home Secretary will make no difference to Labour’s migrant crisis.” The Home Office told The Sun: “Decisions about accommodation are made with careful consideration alongside local authorities, as part of our strategy to reduce dependence on expensive hotel provision and to create a more sustainable and cost-effective asylum system.” by Niamh Harris in News0 Ireland Says It Will Boycott Eurovision 2026 if Israel Is Allowed To Participate Utah Governor Vows To Pursue The Death Penalty For Charlie Kirk’s Killer Copyright © 2025 Fact Checked Limited.

COA chief: ‘Potential conflict of interest’ in commissioner’s wife bagging DPWH projects,"MANILA, Philippines – Commission on Audit Chairperson Gamaliel Cordoba confirmed the veracity of ABS-CBN News’ report that  Olympus Mining and Builders Group Philippines Corporation, the construction firm led by COA Commissioner Mario Lipana’s wife, secured nearly P200 million in public works projects while Lipana was in office. “My personal position is that there is potential conflict of interest,” Cordoba said during the House budget briefing for the COA on Thursday, September 11. Lipana, who is on medical leave, is currently in Singapore. “The integrity of the entire commission is being put into question because one of your commissioners has a spouse who is a contractor that was able to secure and bag a project,” Kamanggagawa Representative Eli San Fernando told the Commission on Audit.

Some People Are Actually Celebrating Charlie Kirk’s Assassination,"Some fanatical leftists and Ukrainian social media users have been openly celebrating the assassination of conservative American activist Charlie Kirk. Kirk was a prominent critic of both Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and former US President Joe Biden’s drive to send hundreds of billions of dollars of military aid to Kiev. He was shot in the neck on Wednesday, in front of his wife and two small children, during a public campus event in Orem, Utah.

De Lima: Marcos’ flood control commission needs more teeth,"MANILA, Philippines — While President Bongbong Marcos has created the Independent Commission for Infrastructure with subpoena powers, Rep. Leila de Lima (ML Party-list) pointed out that it does not have the ability to cite contempt in its flood control probe. In a video statement on Friday, September 12, De Lima picked apart Marcos Jr.’s Executive Order 94, which created the independent body. She recognized that forming an independent body was a step in the right direction, especially amid allegations linking lawmakers to the supposed kickback scheme. But she argued that subpoena powers mean little if the commission cannot cite anyone for contempt. “Useless ang subpoena powers kung hindi mo naman mapapa-contempt,” De Lima said, adding that without contempt powers, the body may not effectively support its ability to recommend disciplinary charges. (Subpoena powers are useless if you cannot cite anyone for contempt.) She further explained that if the commission truly intends to go after those behind the alleged corruption in the Department of Public Works and Highways’ (DPWH) projects, it must be given more teeth. Contempt rules.In the House of Representatives, committees conducting legislative inquiries have the right to cite any person in contempt, so long as it is voted by two-thirds of the members present at the hearing. However, citing someone for contempt should not be done arbitrarily by legislators. Under House rules, there are six grounds for holding a person in contempt: If a committee member believes that a resource person has committed any of the aforementioned acts while being questioned or asked for documents, the panel may vote on citing them in contempt. Typically, resource persons or witnesses are cited in contempt when lawmakers deem they’re lying. While the executive order does not cite any contempt powers, it states that persons who refuse to obey summons, take their oath or testify will be “subject to administrative disciplinary action.” Appearing quite disappointed with the executive order, De Lima touted House Bill 4453 or the proposed Independent Commission Against Infrastructure Corruption Act that she and 11 other lawmakers filed on Tuesday, September 9. She first took issue with the commission’s name, arguing that “Independent Commission for Infrastructure” does not convey the gravity of its mandate to investigate anomalies and corruption. Next, she pointed out that the body’s core function is unclear, given its description as an “ad hoc fact-finding commission,” stressing that fact-finding is not the same as an investigation. Another issue she raised was the lack of legal framework to anchor the body’s probe and its recommendations for charges. “So ilan-ilan na po agad ang nakita ko na medyo kulang. And isa pa, walang banggit tungkol sa Plunder Law, tungkol sa Omnibus Election Code, saka mga procurement laws, parang napaka-general lang ng reference tungkol sa mga batas na mga pwedeng sakop ng mga pagbusisi nung mga nagawa sa mga infrastructure project,” she said. The executive order only mentioned the code of conduct and ethical standards for public officials and employees, revised penal code, administrative code and civil service laws. De Lima also argued that since the body was created by the executive, it only has jurisdiction over employees, officials and agencies under the executive branch. Congress and other constitutional bodies like the Commission on Elections, the Commission on Audit or the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) are also not included. She said the proposed bill she and her colleagues filed clearly include the necessary support agencies, urging both chambers of Congress to ensure such a measure is passed. De Lima also called on the House Infra Committee and Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, both of which are conducting investigations into the anomalous flood control projects and the alleged corruption tied to them, to “give way” to the independent commission instead. This, she said, is necessary to “avoid issues of credibility and conflict of interest,” especially for lawmakers already accused. “Hindi ko po sila hinuhusgahan, hindi ko po sinasabi na guilty sila, pero the very fact, na nababanggit ang mga pangalan ng ilan-ilan na mga miyembro ng House at ng Senado, paano po maniniwala ang publiko sa mga magiging findings and recommendations ng dalawang Komite na yan,” she added. The Independent Commission for Infrastructure’s probe will span 10 years of infrastructure projects, from Aquino’s final year through Duterte’s full term and into Marcos Jr.’s current administration.

Lloyd’s of London Scraps Net Zero Policies,"The new chief executive of Lloyd’s of London has as reversed the insurance market’s net zero policies and given insurers a green light to cover fossil fuels Llyod’s new boss Patrick Tiernan said that the owners of the insurance market “will no longer ask insurers to stop providing insurance cover for coal or other planet-warming fossil fuels”. He toldthe Financial Timesthat Lloyd’s planned to give its insurers more freedom, adding that “we respect the laws of the land” in the countries where they operate and the corporation defers to “the energy mix that the government of [a] jurisdiction chooses”.

By subscribing you agree to ourTerms of Use Ina statementon the Lloyd’s website, Tiernan said: “We must remain apolitical. Our neutrality is part of our value. In a world of strained trade relations, Lloyd’s licence network can be a safe harbour.” Some media reports have blamed(given credit) the White House for the Lloyd’s move which comes “amid a backlash led by Donald Trump against pro-green financing”. The Telegraphreports: Lloyd’s is a centuries-old insurance market where large corporations purchase insurance. As such, many of the world’s largest oil and gas giants use it insure against loss and damage to their fossil fuel projects – putting Lloyd’s in the crosshairs of environmental campaigners who say it facilitates climate change. Mr Tiernan said: “It is important that Lloyd’s remains apolitical. The2050 targetsare government targets. We operate in multiple jurisdictions under different governments with different targets. We have to operate under the policies and the laws of where we operate.” The reversal means Lloyd’s insurers will be free to ignore Mr Neal’s pledge to transform the insurance market into an entirely net zero business by 2050 by blocking insurers from underwriting fossil fuel projects that do not align with the climate target. From now on they will be allowed to continue covering coal mines, coal-fired power plants and Arctic oil sands projects, despite Mr Neal’s pledge to ban insurers from underwriting such projects by 2030. Mr Trump’s victory in the US elections last November has sparked an about-turn in global net zero policies, as the US president pushes to reverse many of the climate initiatives introduced by his predecessor, Joe Biden. The president’s campaign slogan of “drill, baby, drill” has boosted fossil fuel projects and paved the way for many companies to ditch ambitious climate change targets, which some said were unrealistic. In Britain, the Conservatives and Reform UK have made similar pledges to scrap net zero policies, citing concerns about the economic impact of transitioning. Mr Neal, who was named Lloyd’s chief executive in 2018, started outlining Lloyd’s climate policies in 2020, with a view to aligning itself with aims of the Paris Agreement which was signed in 2016. A Lloyd’s of London spokesman said: “Our aim is to support whatever energy mix individual governments determine is in their jurisdiction’s best interests while enabling managing agents to operate at the vanguard of new energy technologies. by Niamh Harris in News0 Israel Attacks ‘Hamas Leadership’ In Qatar German Media Says UK Has No Control Over Migrant Crisis Copyright © 2025 Fact Checked Limited.

The report claims that Britain is ‘in a state of emergency’ and cites how both the Conservatives and Keir Starmer’s Labour government have so far been unable to take control of the small boats crisis, Were either of the parties actually trying to stop the crisis? The Expressreports: The figure is 37% up on this point last year (22,028) and also 37% higher than at this stage in 2023 (21,918), according to PA news agency analysis. It is not just the number of refugees that is causing concern, Bild noted. It added that the UK has “lost control over legal migration”, and “society and infrastructure are groaning” under its weight. The outlet also said: “Neither the healthcare system nor the housing market can keep pace with the sudden population explosion.” Ministers are reportedly looking at using military bases to house asylum seekers in “temporary but adequate” accommodation as Sir Keir Starmer tries to get a grip on the migrant crisis. Ms Mahmood pledged to go “further and faster” on dealing with the issue. She also said the Government would look to bring forward proposals to change domestic legislation and guidance on how the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is implemented in the UK, saying the “balance” between human rights and secure borders “isn’t in the right place at the moment”. In addition, the Home Secretary said that other members of the ECHR were looking to Britain to play a “leading role” in reforming the convention, which entered into force in 1953. She said: “Other countries are struggling with the challenges of mass migration, maintaining our borders, and I think that this is a useful time for us to have a refreshed conversation, and I’m confident we can make more progress.” Moreover, Ms Mahmood suggested that the UK could suspend visas for countries that do not agree to returns deals for migrants. by Niamh Harris in News0 Lloyd’s of London Scraps Net Zero Policies Riot Cops Clash With French Protesters As Macron’s Government Hangs By A Thread Copyright © 2025 Fact Checked Limited.

Did ‘Owly: Just a Little Blue’ inspire Sara Duterte’s ‘Isang Kaibigan’ book?,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Sara Duterte’sIsang Kaibiganchildren’s book has become the topic of heated discussions and memes. The book surfaced at the Senate budget deliberations on the 2025 proposed budget of the Office of the Vice President (OVP) on Tuesday, August 20. Senator Risa Hontiveros questioned what the book that was allocated P10 million under the proposed budget was about, leading to Duterte accusing Hontiveros of politicizing the hearing in anintense exchange. Filipino netizens were quick topoke fun at the book, creating memes that referenced Duterte’s past controversies — like her punching a court sheriff in 2011 when she was Davao City mayor, and her recentpersonal trip to Germanyduring Typhoon Carina. ButIsang Kaibiganhas sparked a new conversation: whether its similarities to the 2009 children’s graphic novelOwly: Just a Little Blueby Andy Runton are just a coincidence. Isang Kaibigantakes on the theme of true friends who help you during tough times. It follows Kwago, an owl who loses his home and all his belongings to a storm. He is then kept company by one friend, Loro, a parrot who helps him rebuild his nest after the onslaught of the heavy rains. Meanwhile,Owly: Just a Little Bluefollows best friends Owly and Wormy, who help a family of bluebirds living in a damaged tree build a new home. However, the family didn’t like it as much as Owly and Wormy would have hoped. When a storm comes, the two friends immediately remember the bluebirds and start working on helping them seek shelter from the rain. It’s the second book in Andy Runton’s graphic novel seriesOwly,which was first published in 2004.Owly: Just a Little Blue‘s original, black-and-white edition with no text was published in 2009. It was laterrepublished in 2020in full color, and with text. Just as there are observed similarities, there are also marked differences in the two books, particularly in their main characters. InIsang Kaibigan,Kwago is surrounded by friends until he lost everything during a storm. He was in despair and felt helpless until his last remaining friend came to his rescue. InJust a Little Blue, Owly is a kind, generous, and pro-active character who goes out of his way to help others and, in the process, gains friends. Author and activist Ninotchka Rosca first posted aboutOwly: Just a Little Blue, on Wednesday, August 21, explaining the book’s synopsis. “Ay, natawa ako(I laughed),” Rosca wrote right after the book’s description. Other Filipino writers then began to take notice of the supposed similarities between Duterte’s book and Runton’s book. Rappler columnist Antonio J. Montalvan II questioned if the reason behind Duterte’s outburst during her exchange with Hontiveros was because the book was plagiarized. “Is this the reason for the tantrum? The question was simple – what is the book about? Then she flared up.Dahil ba [plagiarized] ang book(Is it because the book is plagiarized)? That’s [P10 million] for possible plagiarism,” Montalvan wrote. Meanwhile, another netizen called on others to search up the otherOwlybooks to check for plagiarism, also speculating that this could be the reason why Duterte had gotten upset during the budget hearing. In an X post, journalist Raissa Robles also asked Runton to check if he thinksIsang Kaibiganbears any similarities with his book. To@Owly– Pls look if this book looks similar to yours. Thanks.https://t.co/7ynveGhKFn As of this writing, however, Runton has yet to comment on the matter. As accusations of plagiarism spread online, Vice President Duterte issued a statement rejecting the claims, saying it was easy to write a short story based on experience, and hinted on her upcoming book about betrayal. Isang Kaibiganis part of the OVP’s flagship program, “PagbaBAGo Campaign,” where one million beneficiaries will receive bags that contain the book. The book is 16 pages long, and was published by the OVP.– Rappler.com How does this make you feel? follow us",Real
FACT CHECK: Romualdez not suspended from House of Representatives,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. Claim:House Speaker Martin Romualdez was suspended from office. Why we fact-checked this:The YouTube video bearing the claim, posted on June 25, has gained 18,894 views, 455 likes, and 82 comments. The video’s thumbnail shows photos of Romualdez, Vice President Sara Duterte, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. seemingly holding a document. Text on the thumbnail reads: “Pina-suspend si Martin(Martin was suspended).” The bottom line:Romualdez remains a member of the lower chamber and is House Speaker of thecurrent 19th Congress. While the video’s thumbnail implies that Marcos ordered Romualdez’s suspension, the President cannot suspend a sitting House member.Article VI, Section 16, of the Constitutionexplains the process: “Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds of all its Members, suspend or expel a Member. A penalty of suspension, when imposed, shall not exceed sixty days.” Romualdez and Duterte ties:The misleading video didn’t provide any information to prove its claim. Instead, the narrator merely commented on Romualdez’s remarks on Duterte’s decision to resign from the Marcos Cabinet. Asked to comment on the Vice Presidentstepping down as education secretary, Romualdez said: “As the Vice President mentioned, I think this was her personal decision, and we respect the decision.” Romualdez served as Duterte’s campaign manager during the 2022 elections and both were then members of the political party Lakas-CMD. However, rumors of an alleged rift swirled during the 2023 budget hearings, when the House of Representativesstripped Duterte of her confidential fundsfor 2024. The Vice President’s political allies were alsodemotedfrom their senior roles in the lower chamber, and some lawmakers began supporting probes into the Dutertes, particularlyresolutionsurging government cooperation with the International Criminal Court’s investigation into former president Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war. On June 24, Romualdez said he still wished Duterte well. “We only wish the vice president nothing but the best and we wish her always the best of luck in all endeavors and in her service to the Filipino people.”–Andrei Santos/Rappler.com Andrei Santos is a graduate of Rappler’s fact-checking mentorship program.

Here’s a look back at the moments in local pop culture history when veteran and emerging Filipino satirists took center stage. Impersonating someone is one way of picking apart social issues, and perhaps no one does it better in the Philippines than thelate Willie Nepomuceno, who deemed himself as an “impressionist” of many public figures in politics and pop culture. An alumnus of the College of Fine Arts at the University of the Philippines Diliman, he first started out by imitating the voices of the Reycard Duet andQueen of Kundiman singer Sylvia La Torrefor his classmates. He rose to fame as an impersonator when he started dressing himself up as Ferdinand Marcos Sr. during the surge of theFirst Quarter Stormin the late president’s term. A known activist, Nepomuceno used his artistic talents in rallies by dressing up in costumes and imitating voices in order for the people to listen. Utilizing comedy, his acting methods and theatrics made such strong impact during these rallies in the 1970s that the government personally asked him to stop impersonating  Marcos Sr. In February 2022, “Willie Nep” participated in the36th anniversary celebration of the EDSA People Power Revolutiondressed as the late president. Nepomuceno also drew a lot of chuckles every time he lampooned legendary actors like Fernando Poe Jr. and Dolphy, as well as many other political figures, including former presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Estrada and Noynoy Aquino. “They say comedy is just a twist from reality… I thinkmas nakakatawa ’yung original, ’yung mga totoong nangyayari(the original is funnier, the ones actually happening),their statements,” Nepomuceno said in a2018 interviewwith Inquirer. Nepomucenodiedin 2023 at 75 due to a head injury, but unquestionably, inspired many other Filipino comedians to use impersonations as a means to advocate political and social awareness. “Isang platitong mani(A plate of peanuts),” is just one of the memorable phrases that’s familiar to Filipinos in the ’80s and ’90s, all because ofMongolian Barbecuestar Mr. Shooli — the genius who kept everyone in stitches amid the uncertain political times. Manuel “Jun” Urbano Jr. was a comedian, filmmaker, actor, and director who created the well known television character of Mr. Shooli, a Mongolian national with a Chinese accent who commentates on the state of Philippine politics. As Mr. Shooli, Urbano managed to toe the line between serious discussion and playful yet non-offensive banter between him and the guests that he invited. HIs gags, often guised as somewhat innocent statements on Philippine politics, caught the likes of former presidents Fidel V. Ramos and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo off guard with his charm. At at one point, Urbano also had former presidential son and now Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. guest in the show. Just months beforehis deathin December 2023, Urbano was honored in August with theFilipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) Dr. Jose R. Perez Memorial Awardfor his contributions to Philippine cinema. In October of the same year, the 84-year-old Urbano was bestowed with theGawad Plaridel awardfrom the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Mass Communication. His famed alter ego Mr. Shooli gave the acceptance speech, and of course, wouldn’t be without a quip: “Noong araw, ‘pag ikaw may problema, sisigaw ka, ‘Tulong, pulis! Tulong, pulis!’ Ngayon ‘pag may problema ka, ikaw sisigaw, ‘Tulong, may pulis, may pulis!’”he joked, drawing laughs from the crowd. (Back in the day, when you had a problem, you would shout, ‘Police, help! Police, help!’ Now, if you have a problem, you would instead shout, ‘Help, there’s a cop, there’s a cop!) You’d think that the Cory Aquino administration would be safe from social commentary as she’s the first female president who inspired a people’s revolution, but well, there wasSic O’Clock Newson television. Sic O’Clock Newswas a political satire show that ran from January 1987 to September 1990 via the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC). Directed byMarilou Diaz-Abaya, the show featured an ensemble cast led by Jaime Fabregas, Ces Quesada, and Manny Castañeda and discussed pressing issues during Aquino’s term. Long before social media memes about politicians, the show was already dishing them, with other actors joining the mix like Junix Inocian, Joji Isla, Hero Bautista, Rene Requiestas, Wilson Go, Jon Achaval, Celeste Bueno, Dina Padilla, Errol Dionisio, Ching Arellano, Khryss Adalia, Nonoy Oplas, Nonie Buencamino, and Domeng Landicho. Unfortunately, IBC was sequestered by the government, which led to the demise of the show in 1990. With the rise of ABS-CBN as one of the more prominent broadcasting companies in the country, manytelenovelasmade the network popular among viewers, but the satiricalAbangan ang Susunod na Kabanataheld its own. Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanataaired from January 1991 to June 1997 with a star-studded cast led by Noel Trinidad, Tessie Tomas, Nova Villa, Roderick Paulate, Freddie Webb, and Nanette Inventor. The plot revolves around the day to day lives of the three families: Tengco, Delos Santos, and Lagmay. They cross each other’s paths multiple times in the series’ run, with the characters expressing their disappointment on various social and political issues. Abanganhad Johnny Manahan as director and Jose Javier “Joey” Reyes, the current president of the Film Development Council of the Philippines, as writer, as well as actors Anjo Yllana, Carmi Martin, Sammy Lagmay, Winnie Cordero, Joji Isla, Jennifer Sevilla, Jolina Magdangal, Ina Raymundo, and Carmina Villaroel. The ’90s classic also had a sequel,Eto Na Ang Susunod na Kabanata, with the cast reprising their roles. It ran from April to September 2001. Asone of the longest running gag showsin the Philippines,Bubble Gangfirst premiered in October 1995 with Uro dela Cruz serving as the show’s director. Originally, the cast featured Michael V. and Ogie Alcasid, along with Antonio Aquitania, Sunshine Cruz, Jackie de Guzman, Assunta de Rossi, Eric Fructuoso, Susan Lozada, Aiko Melendez, and Wendell Ramos. Since then, an assortment of old and new faces came and went, but the show’s original pillar remained: Michael V. As the longest staying cast member, Michael V. has given comedic performances that sent Filipino audiences crying with laughter as his creativity and imagination truly shine. He’s known for writing and spoofing many OPM songs like“Waiting Here sa Pila” as Lola Kanor, a parody on “Raining in Manila” by Lola Amour; to“Salarin, Salarin” with castmates turned girl group BINI-b10as their take on the nation’s girl group BINI hit, “Salamin, Salamin.” But Michael V. also never fails to parody the big shots in the government. The renowned comedian recreated the look of pre-neck brace former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (amusingly renamed as Gloria Makapal-Arroyo) in “Cabinet Meeting,” aired in February 2001. He even matches the placement of the mole on her face. He also stars in skits that tackle political and social issues, like thenepo babiesflaunting their luxurious lifestyle and therampancy of political dynastiesthat the country faces every election. And Michael V.’s most recent? Contractor Sarah Discaya, who, along with her husband Curlee, got entangled in controversial flood control government projects. Meet Ciala Dismaya. Coming from the Filipino wordsshala, slang forsosyal(fancy) anddismaya(disappointment), Ciala Dismaya will debut in the Michael V. universe asBubble Gangteases the character on social media. On August 18, Michael V.renewed his contractwith GMA, with the networks’ top brass present led by president and chief executive officer Gilberto R. Duavit, Jr., underlining the veteran comedian’s value in the industry. Jon Santos is a longtime comedian, theater actor, and performer known for his own impersonations of public figures and pop culture icons — from Governor Vi to Paris Over-the-Hill to Senator Meeryam Defensive Defender. Not lost, too, are his spoofs on beauty queens2013 Miss World PhilippinesMegan Youngand 2018Miss Universe winnerCatriona Gray; and several post-Marcos presidents, from Kuring to Sherap. In late 2024, Rappler had the privilege to talk to the veteran comedian in aRappler Talkepisode, where he invited viewers to his comeback standup comedy show entitledNaughty and Nice. With guest stars drag queen Vinas Deluxe, singer Ice Seguerra and band Apo Hiking Society, it was set for a one-night only performance, but unfortunately, it waspostponeddue to unforeseen circumstances. The seasoned impersonator, though, is still very much around, and he’s also part of the rotating judges ofDrag Race Philippinesfor the past three seasons in the show hosted by Paolo Ballesteros. And who could forget  Ate Glow completely recreating former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo? Renee Hampshire is a comedian famous in the early 2000s. Her impersonation of the former president started at a variety show at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where she was then pursuing her studies. Notably, this was around the time when the impeachment trial of then president Joseph Ejercito “Erap” Estrada was ongoing. Arroyo was the vice president, who then succeeded Estrada after the EDSA II in January 2001. With the impersonations and rally performances came the problem of her morals clashing with her political beliefs. It wasn’t a hidden fact that she had criticized Arroyo in some events. “Where do I draw the line? There were times I couldn’t tell if I was thinking as Renee or Ate Glow. It was like I became her,” she said in aninterview with VICE. When Arroyo’s  presidency ended, she also bid goodbye to her character. Shegot marriedto her British boyfriend in 2016. Activist and actress Mae Paner also turns to her alter ego Juana Change in her monologues during rallies and peaceful protests. Paner was aPsychology graduate of the University of Santo Tomas.Debuting in theater during the ’70s while pursuing her studies, she started taking production assistant and small-time actress roles in the industry. In August 2013, she took part in theMillion People March. It was a mass protest against thepork barrel scamheld at Luneta Park and the Quirino Grandstand. Juana Change donned a blonde wig with a mask that resembled a pig, and she wore a barrel with the words “Scrap Pork Barrel.” She was seen wearing a red one-piece suit and a necklace to match. Previously, she has spoken up about theextrajudicial killings inTao Po, an interactive monologue held at the Cultural Center of the Philippines in August 2019. She also appeared as matriarch Imelda Marcos during the 36th EDSA People Power Revolution anniversary. Coming out of the pandemic, millennials and Gen Zs started speaking their minds again on the Philippine political climate. Inday Tasha, a former food market server in the Katipunan area of Quezon City, grew in popularity on social media due to her similarities to Vice President Sara Duterte. She started acknowledging this new persona through her social media posts that make lighthearted fun of the scandals and controversies that the Vice President is facing. With the fame of being the lookalike of a politician comes the comments, both positive and negative, from Filipino netizens. In an interview with ABS-CBN News, “Vee Pee Sara” said:“Meron pong mga negative, kokonti lang po, mas marami pa rin po ‘yung positive side na nagsu-support sa akin at natutuwa, ‘yung mga negative comments po hindi ko po siya tinatake for me kasi wala naman po akong ginagawang masama, wala rin naman po akong ginagawang mali, as long as hindi po ako nagtatapak ng tao and hindi ko rin po siya sinsiraan, hindi ko siya minumura, hindi ko siya ginagawan ng masamang video and hindi ako nagbibigay ng maling information.” (There are negative comments. There are more comments on the positive side who support me and are amused, rather than the negative side. I don’t take the negative comments to heart because I’m not doing anything bad, and I’m not doing anything wrong either. I’m not destroying her reputation, cussing her out, or making videos with bad intentions about her. I also don’t give out incorrect information about her.) From Willie Nepomuceno’s bold impersonations to Inday Tasha’s viral parodies, Filipinos have long turned to comedy in order to process and ascertain the country’s pressing current issues and events. Political satire may have evolved from stage performances to online forum posting, but the purpose of humor remains the same — to challenge power through humor. Whether in rallies, on TV, or online, Filipinos use comedy to make sense of politics, turning laughter into a tool for awareness and critique.– Rappler.com Juliana Chloe Gonzales is a Rappler intern studying AB Communication Arts at De La Salle University.

Ombudsman dismisses complaint vs Remulla over ICC handover of Duterte,"MANILA, Philippines — The Office of the Ombudsman has dropped the cases against Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, which were filed by Sen. Imee Marcos. This has been confirmed by Remulla to reporters on Friday, September 21. The case dismissed by the Ombudsman concerned the government’s handover of detained former President Rodrigo Duterte to the International Criminal Court. Marcos filed the complaint in May 2025. Remulla and several others were accused of arbitrary detention and violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. This complaint had hindered Remulla’s application for the Ombudsman position, as he was not cleared by the said office, according to Supreme Court Spokesperson Camille Ting on September 2. With his case dismissed, he can now secure a clearance from the Office of the Ombudsman, a requirement by the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) for nominations to posts deliberated by them. However, JBC sources toldPhilstar.comon Friday afternoon that they have yet to receive a clearance from the Ombudsman. In a statement, Marcos said that she filed a motion for reconsideration on Remulla’s case. This story is to be updated once the JBC receives the clearance from the Office of the Ombudsman.

Ombudsman clears DOJ chief Remulla in complaints filed by Imee Marcos,"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. DOJ CHIEF. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla speaks to the media prior to his meeting with UN Special Rapporteur Dr. Morris Tidball-Binz at the Department of Justice on February 7, 2023. Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Office of the Ombudsman has dismissed the complaints filed bySenator Imee Marcosagainst Department of Justice (DOJ) SecretaryJesus Crispin “Boying” Remullaand several others in connection to the International Criminal Courtarrest of former president Rodrigo Dutertein March. Remulla confirmed this on Friday, September 12, when asked about the Ombudsman decision. Department of the Interior and Local Government Secretary Juanito Victor “Jonvic” Remulla — one of the other respondents — also confirmed to Rappler the dismissal of the complaints against them. Ahead of the confirmation of Remulla’s clearance in the criminal and administrative complaints, Marcos said on Friday that she will file a motion for reconsideration with the Ombudsman. “I filed my motion for reconsideration within the day the decision was rendered. It was clearly filed on time. Therefore, Secretary Boying Remulla still has a pending case before the Office of the Ombudsman,” the senator said. After conducting a Senate probe into the arrest which experts said was legal and regular, the senator forwarded her committee’s findings to the Ombudsman, triggering the cases against Remulla and the officials. The complaints included grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service; and arbitrary detention, usurpation of judicial functions, grave threats, graft, usurpation of authority or official functions, false testimony in other cases, and perjury. Remulla is applying to be the next Ombudsman — an office that holds the power to suspend, fire, and probe erring government officials. Imee’s complaintsalmost cost Remulla his spotin the list of applicants. There were concerns back in August that the DOJ chief might be disqualified because of his pending Ombudsman cases. Under the2020 revised rulesof theJudicial and Bar Council (JBC), the body that leads the selection of justices and ombudsmen, applicants with pending criminal and administrative complaints may be disqualified. JBC rules also require applicants to submit a clearance from several government agencies and another clearance if they have pending administrative complaints, like in Remulla’s case. Remulla went through with the JBC’s interviews, but revealed on September 2 that he has yet to secure a clearance from the Ombudsman as his cases were still active back then. “It’s still there; it’s still pending. I’ll be filing a motion so that this will be resolved as soon as possible,” Remulla told reporters after his JBC public interview. SC spokesperson Camille Sue Mae Ting said the JBC allowed Remulla to file his clearance until the end of its deliberations, which was “two weeks” from September 3. This means that the DOJ chief’s deadline could be around September 17. This was crucial because if Remulla was not able to produce a clearance, his name will not be included in the JBC short list to be submitted to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The next Ombudsman will serve until 2032. Based on sources and on-ground rumblings, Remulla is among the frontrunners in the race for the successor of Samuel Martires, Rodrigo Duterte’s appointee who retired in late July. Among the other frontrunners are Philippine Competition Commission chief Mike Aguinaldo and former Bureau of Internal Revenue commissioner Kim Henares. –Rappler.com How does this make you feel? follow us",Fake
Trump Praises West Point For Canceling Awards Ceremony For ‘Evil’ Tom Hanks,"President Trump has congratulated a US Military Academy for cancelling an awards ceremony to honor actor Tom Hanks.

Fact check: Viral posts claiming Alex Eala commented on Charlie Kirk's death are false,"MANILA, Philippines — Right-wing activist and influencer Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck and killed while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University on Thursday, September 11 (Manila time). While many have shared their reactions, circulating posts claiming Filipina tennis star Alex Eala commented on the incident are false. Several athletes, including NBA stars Michael Porter Jr., Patrick Beverley and Dwight Howard, posted statements regarding Kirk’s death. UFC fighters Colby Covington, Sean Strickland and Aljamain Sterling also slammed the shooting of Kirk in separate social media posts. Several Filipino celebrities likewise mourned the death of Kirk. But a tennis Facebook page, Tennis Together, said an emotional Eala “shared her deep grief” on Kirk’s death. “She said that Mr. Kirk — who had silently supported and paved the way for her first career opportunities — had always been a great spiritual support,” Tennis Together’s Thursday post claimed. “Through tears, Eala choked up and said: 'Every victory I have from now on will be in memory of him. I will continue to fight, because that is the only way to thank him for the trust and kindness he gave me,'"" it added. Another Facebook post, made Thursday evening, said that the 20-year-old called “for a moment of silence in memory of Charlie Kirk.” Another one made Friday morning, September 12, said the Filipina went to the US to pay respects to “her godfather.” “She choked up: “I will come to you one last time… rest in peace, I will always make you proud,” the page claimed. The posts showed Eala, who is coming off a second-round win over Julia Riera of Argentina, 6-1, 6-4, in the Sao Paulo Open. There is currently no proof that Eala, who is currently having a historic year, has made these types of statements regarding Kirk. There is also no proof that Kirk is Eala’s godfather. After winning over Riera, she made her speech, saying that Brazilians are “super hospitable.” “That’s one thing I think that we have in common with the Philippines. I’m feeling at home and I love the atmosphere tonight,” she said in a speech. Eala’s last social media post was after winning over Riera. Her social media posts usually state updates on her tennis journey, and not her political views. The first post supposedly saying Kirk “had always been a great spiritual support” had more than 115,000 reactions on Facebook and over 1,900 comments. The post was shared more than 5,700 times. Sports journalist Carlo Pamintuan commented on the “post,” slamming it as he asked, “Yall really believe [things] like this?” Other comments, though, said Eala “has a very soft and grateful heart full of love,” and that she has “such a strong and brave soul” and “her words are so inspiring.” Another commenter said he is “deeply moved by Alexandra Eala's heartfelt tribute to her mentor, Mr. Kirk; her strength in the face of tragedy is truly inspiring.” One more said Eala’s “action” was an “incredibly heartfelt and emotional tribute to someone who clearly made a huge impact on her life, it's beautiful to see her strength and determination shine through in her words and actions.” The post made Thursday evening, on the other hand, garnered more than 6,100 reactions, 358 shares and 224 comments as of publication time. A commenter said Eala is “an ambassador for our humanity,” while another said Eala’s words “are truly inspiring.” However, another netizen called it out, humorously making a Jeopardy-like joke. “I'll take $100 on things that never happened. What is ""Alex Eala's reaction to the death of Charlie Kirk,” social media user Jam Jam said. Another, Ryan Marsh, said that Eala “did not” make the comment, which garnered one angry reaction. More netizens slammed the “statement,” calling out the page for fake news, including lawyer Jesus Falcis. Others even called for the page to be reported, while a bulk of the commenters also cursed at the page. Still, some seemingly believed it. The Facebook page also posted several Eala fake news, including one that she received red roses from NBA star and New York Knicks Jordan Clarkson. The page is still up and running, with more than 11,000 followers. Philstar.com is one of the most vibrant, opinionated, discerning communities of readers on cyberspace.

Shackled and Smirking: Pint-Sized Pedophile’s ICE Arrest Photo Goes Viral,"A convicted child predator from Guatemala was arrested in New Orleans by ICE — but it wasn’t his rap sheet that first stunned the public.

He was expected to be deported back to Mexico, according to ICE San Diego. Hernandez’s gaze was tilted towards the ground as he looked ahead sullenly.

"As Marcos marks father’s legacy, anti-corruption protests rock EDSA","MANILA, Philippines — “We will not allow for any great power, any person, to humiliate or to put down any Filipino.” Celebrating his father’s birthday in their bailiwick of Ilocos Norte, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. spoke of their legacy and service. Surrounded by members of the Marcos clan, he spoke of the standard Ferdinand Marcos Sr. left. “We must remember, we must be motivated by the lessons that he left with us. The lessons that we must exercise good judgment and always, always side with the national interest, in the interest of Filipinos. In everything that we do, we must be motivated by a true commitment to service, and a true – it must be driven by a true love of every single Filipino and a love for the Republic of the Philippines,” Marcos said in a wreath-laying ceremony in honor of his father. More than 500 kilometers away in the nation’s capital, hundreds of protesters took to EDSA to rally against the administration’s biggest corruption scandal yet. “PUNISH ALL PLUNDERERS!” one of the biggest signs read. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority estimated that there were around 200 people gathered at the EDSA Shrine: the very monument that commemorated the People Power protests that overthrew Marcos Sr.’s dictatorship in 1986. It has since been used as a shrine symbolizing mass organization and freedom. “We cannot allow the collusion of contractors, district engineers, and high officials to rob us blind. Everyone involved in corruption must be held to account,” Akbayan Partylist Rep. Perci Cendaña said. Cendaña and Akbayan were among the groups who attended the protests. Marcos himself was the first to call attention to the flood control mess, with large sums of public funds going into ghost flood projects. While he has asked the public for calm, the floodgates have been opened. The corruption scandal has rocked both the executive and the legislative branches, with officials being tagged in alleged kickback schemes and money laundering exploits. While President Marcos has not been directly linked to the flood control controversy, his father’s rule has long faced questions over corruption. The Guinness World Records listed the Marcos-era corruption as “the Greatest Robbery of a Government,” while the World Bank and UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that $5 billion to $10 billion was taken from public funds. Marcos Jr. has consistently denied any wrongdoing by his father, but critics say this raises doubts about his ability to lead a strong anti-corruption campaign.

A supporter of US President Donald Trump waves a US flag in front of the White House during an event in support of US right-wing activist, commentator, Charlie Kirk and individuals charged in connection with the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, after Kirk was shot dead during an event at Utah Valley University, in Washington, DC, on September 11, 2025. Nathan Howard/Reuters UTAH, USA – A suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activistCharlie Kirkat a Utah university has been taken into custody, US President Donald Trump said on Friday, September 12, ending an intense manhunt that followed what Trump described as a “heinous assassination.” Kirk’s killer had eluded police and federal agents for more than 24 hours after the shooting on Wednesday, September 10, in which a sniper fired a single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, during an appearance at Utah Valley University in Orem. “I think we have him,” Trump told theFox and Friends show in an interview, adding that a person who knows the suspect had turned him in. “I think with a high degree of certainty we have him in custody.” Trump did not share the suspect’s identity. Investigators were due to brief journalists later on Friday. The suspect was in the custody of Utah state law enforcement, a person familiar with the investigation said, asking for anonymity. Previously, US investigators said they had found the bolt-action rifle believed to have been used to kill Kirk and released images of a person of interest. The FBI had circulated grainy images apparently taken from security cameras showing a person wearing a black top, black sunglasses and a dark baseball cap. The long-sleeved top appears to have been emblazoned with an image of a bald eagle flying across a US flag. Law enforcement officials also releasedvideo of the shooterrunning across the roof and lowering himself on to the ground. “Somebody this close recognizes even a little tilt of the head, which nobody else would do,” Trump said in the interview. Kirk, an author, podcast host and close ally of Trump, helped build the Republican Party’s support among younger voters. Trump said the suspect was recognized by people close to him, and suggested the suspect’s father drove him to a police station and handed him over. FBI and state officials said the killer arrived on the campus a few minutes before the start of the event, a debate led by Kirk titled “Prove Me Wrong” in front of 3,000 people at Utah Valley, about 40 miles (65 km) south of Salt Lake City. Security-camera videos showed a person going up stairwells to gain access to a roof before firing at Kirk, the officials said. Kirk, a staunch defender of gun rights, was answering an audience question about mass shootings when the bullet struck his neck. Audience members fled in panic. After the shooting, investigators found a “high-powered, bolt-action” rifle in a nearby wooded area, and were examining that along with palm prints and footprints for clues. The shooter appeared to be of college age and “blended in well” on the campus, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said at the Thursday briefing, September 11. Kirk was the co-founder and president of the conservative student group Turning Point USA and appeared at Utah Valley on Wednesday as part of a planned 15-event “American Comeback Tour” of US college campuses. His killingstirred outrage and denunciations of political violencefrom Democrats, Republicans and foreign governments. Trump said he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. Kirk, who was married and the father of two young children, was celebrated by Republicans as a charismatic advocate for right-wing policies on race, gender, immigration, religion and gun regulation. He frequently engaged with his critics from the far left to the far right, often inviting members of his audiences to debate him live. –Rappler.com How does this make you feel? follow us",Fake
